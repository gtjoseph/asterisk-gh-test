</ul>
<h3>User Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>ast_coredumper: check ast_debug_tools.conf permissions</h4>
<p>ast_debug_tools.conf must be owned by root and not be
  writable by other users or groups to be used by ast_coredumper or
  by ast_logescalator or ast_loggrabber when run as root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_websocket.conf.sample: Fix category name.</h4>
<p>The category name in the chan_websocket.conf.sample file was
  incorrect.  It should be "global" instead of "general".</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>cli.c: Allow 'channel request hangup' to accept patterns.</h4>
<p>The 'channel request hangup' CLI command now accepts
  multiple channel names, POSIX Extended Regular Expressions, glob-like
  patterns, or a combination of all of them. See the CLI command 'core
  show help channel request hangup' for full details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_sorcery_memory_cache: Reduce cache lock time for sorcery memory cache populate command</h4>
<p>The AMI command sorcery memory cache populate will now
  return an error if there is an internal error performing the populate.
  The CLI command will display an error in this case as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_geolocation:  Fix multiple issues with XML generation.</h4>
<p>Geolocation: Two new optional profile parameters have been added.</p>
</li>
<li><code>pidf_element_id</code> which sets the value of the <code>id</code> attribute on the top-level
    PIDF-LO <code>device</code>, <code>person</code> or <code>tuple</code> elements.</li>
<li>
<p><code>device_id</code> which sets the content of the <code>&lt;deviceID&gt;</code> element.
  Both parameters can include channel variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_messaging: Add support for following 3xx redirects</h4>
<p>A new pjsip endpoint option follow_redirect_methods was added.
  This option is a comma-delimited, case-insensitive list of SIP methods
  for which SIP 3XX redirect responses are followed. An alembic upgrade
  script has been added for adding this new option to the Asterisk
  database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>taskprocessors: Improve logging and add new cli options</h4>
<p>New CLI command has been added -
  core show taskprocessor name <taskprocessor-name></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ccss:  Add option to ccss.conf to globally disable it.</h4>
<p>A new "enabled" parameter has been added to ccss.conf.  It defaults
  to "yes" to preserve backwards compatibility but CCSS is rarely used so
  setting "enabled = no" in the "general" section can save some unneeded channel
  locking operations and log message spam.  Disabling ccss will also prevent
  the func_callcompletion and chan_dahdi modules from loading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Makefile: Add module-list-* targets.</h4>
<p>Try "make module-list-deprecated" to see what modules
  are on their way out the door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_mixmonitor: Add 's' (skip) option to delay recording.</h4>
<p>This change introduces a new 's(<seconds>)' (skip) option to the MixMonitor
  application. Example:
    MixMonitor(${UNIQUEID}.wav,s(3))
  This skips recording for the first 3 seconds before writing audio to the file.
  Existing MixMonitor behavior remains unchanged when the 's' option is not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue.c: Only announce to head caller if announce_to_first_user</h4>
<p>When announce_to_first_user is false, no announcements are played to the head caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stir_shaken: Add STIR_SHAKEN_ATTESTATION dialplan function.</h4>
<p>The STIR_SHAKEN_ATTESTATION dialplan function has been added
  which will allow suppressing attestation on a call-by-call basis
  regardless of the profile attached to the outgoing endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>func_channel: Allow R/W of ADSI CPE capability setting.</h4>
<p>CHANNEL(adsicpe) can now be read or written to change
  the channels' ADSI CPE capability setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>func_hangupcause.c: Add access to Reason headers via HANGUPCAUSE()</h4>
<p>Added a new option to HANGUPCAUSE to access additional
  information about hangup reason. Reason headers from pjsip
  could be read using 'tech_extended' cause type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>func_math: Add DIGIT_SUM function.</h4>
<p>The DIGIT_SUM function can be used to return the digit sum of
  a number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_sf: Add post-digit timer option to ReceiveSF.</h4>
<p>The 't' option for ReceiveSF now allows for a timer since
  the last digit received, in addition to the number-wide timeout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_dial: Allow fractional seconds for dial timeouts.</h4>
<p>The answer and progress dial timeouts now have millisecond
  precision, instead of having to be whole numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Add DAHDI_CHANNEL function.</h4>
<p>The DAHDI_CHANNEL function allows for getting/setting
  certain properties about DAHDI channels from the dialplan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue.c: Add new global 'log_unpause_on_reason_change'</h4>
<p>Add new global option 'log_unpause_on_reason_change' that
  is default disabled. When enabled cause addition of UNPAUSE event on
  every re-PAUSE with reason changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>pbx_builtins: Allow custom tone for WaitExten.</h4>
<p>The tone used while waiting for digits in WaitExten
  can now be overridden by specifying an argument for the 'd'
  option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_tonedetect: Add option for TONE_DETECT detection to auto stop.</h4>
<p>The 'e' option for TONE_DETECT now allows detection to
  be disabled automatically once the desired number of matches have
  been fulfilled, which can help prevent race conditions in the
  dialplan, since TONE_DETECT does not need to be disabled after
  a hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sorcery: Prevent duplicate objects and ensure missing objects are created on update</h4>
<p>Users relying on Sorcery multiple writable backends configurations
  (e.g., astdb + realtime) may now enable update_or_create_on_update_miss = yes
  in sorcery.conf to ensure missing objects are recreated after temporary backend
  failures. Default behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_websocket: Allow additional URI parameters to be added to the outgoing URI.</h4>
<p>A new WebSocket channel driver option <code>v</code> has been added to the
  Dial application that allows you to specify additional URI parameters on
  outgoing connections. Run <code>core show application Dial</code> from the Asterisk CLI
  to see how to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_chanspy: Add option to not automatically answer channel.</h4>
<p>ChanSpy and ExtenSpy can now be configured to not
  automatically answer the channel by using the 'N' option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>cel: Add STREAM_BEGIN, STREAM_END and DTMF event types.</h4>
<p>Enabling the tracking of the
  STREAM_BEGIN and the STREAM_END event
  types in cel.conf will log media files and
  music on hold played to each channel.
  The STREAM_BEGIN event's extra field will
  contain a JSON with the file details (path,
  format and language), or the class name, in
  case of music on hold is played. The DTMF
  event's extra field will contain a JSON with
  the digit and the duration in milliseconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_srtp: Add menuselect options to enable AES_192, AES_256 and AES_GCM</h4>
<p>Options are now available in the menuselect "Resource Modules"
  category that allow you to enable the AES_192, AES_256 and AES_GCM
  cipher suites in res_srtp. Of course, libsrtp and OpenSSL must support
  them but modern versions do.  Previously, the only way to enable them was
  to set the CFLAGS environment variable when running ./configure.
  The default setting is to disable them preserving existing behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>cdr: add CANCEL dispostion in CDR</h4>
<p>A new CDR option "canceldispositionenabled" has been added
  that when set to true, the NO ANSWER disposition will be split into
  two dispositions: CANCEL and NO ANSWER. The default value is 'no'</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>func_curl: Allow auth methods to be set.</h4>
<p>The httpauth field in CURLOPT now allows the authentication
  methods to be set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Media over Websocket Channel Driver</h4>
<p>A new channel driver "chan_websocket" is now available. It can
  exchange media over both inbound and outbound websockets and will both frame
  and re-time the media it receives.
  See http://s.asterisk.net/mow for more information.
  The ARI channels/externalMedia API now includes support for the</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stir_shaken.so: Handle X5U certificate chains.</h4>
<p>The STIR/SHAKEN verification process will now load a full
  certificate chain retrieved via the X5U URL instead of loading only
  the end user cert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stir_shaken: Add "ignore_sip_date_header" config option.</h4>
<p>A new STIR/SHAKEN verification option "ignore_sip_date_header" has
  been added that when set to true, will cause the verification process to
  not consider a missing or invalid SIP "Date" header to be a failure.  This
  will make the IAT the sole "truth" for Date in the verification process.
  The option can be set in the "verification" and "profile" sections of
  stir_shaken.conf.
  Also fixed a bug in the port match logic.
  Resolves: #1251
  Resolves: #1271</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_record: Add RECORDING_INFO function.</h4>
<p>The RECORDING_INFO function can now be used
  to retrieve the duration of a recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue: queue rules – Add support for QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=rN to raise penalties only for members within min/max range</h4>
<p>This change introduces QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=rN, allowing selective penalty raises
  only for members whose current penalty is within the [min_penalty, max_penalty] range.
  Members with lower or higher penalties are unaffected.
  This behavior is backward-compatible with existing queue rule configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_odbc: cache_size option to limit the cached connections.</h4>
<p>New cache_size option for res_odbc to on a per class basis limit the
  number of cached connections. Please reference the sample configuration
  for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_odbc: cache_type option for res_odbc.</h4>
<p>When using res_odbc it should be noted that back-end
  connections to the underlying database can now be configured to re-use
  the cached connections in a round-robin manner rather than repeatedly
  re-using the same connection.  This helps to keep connections alive, and
  to purge dead connections from the system, thus more dynamically
  adjusting to actual load.  The downside is that one could keep too many
  connections active for a longer time resulting in resource also begin
  consumed on the database side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ARI Outbound Websockets</h4>
<p>Asterisk can now establish websocket sessions <em>to</em> your ARI applications
  as well as accepting websocket sessions <em>from</em> them.
  Full details: http://s.asterisk.net/ari-outbound-ws</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_websocket_client: Create common utilities for websocket clients.</h4>
<p>A new module "res_websocket_client" and config file
  "websocket_client.conf" have been added to support several upcoming new
  capabilities that need common websocket client configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>asterisk.c: Add option to restrict shell access from remote consoles.</h4>
<p>A new asterisk.conf option 'disable_remote_console_shell' has
  been added that, when set, will prevent remote consoles from executing
  shell commands using the '!' prefix.
  Resolves: #GHSA-c7p6-7mvq-8jq2</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Add Call Waiting Deluxe support.</h4>
<p>Call Waiting Deluxe can now be enabled for FXS channels
  by enabling its corresponding option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>stasis/control.c: Set Hangup Cause to No Answer on Dial timeout</h4>
<p>A Dial timeout on POST /channels/{channelId}/dial will now result in a
  CANCEL and ChannelDestroyed with cause 19 / User alerting, no answer.  Previously
  no explicit cause was set, resulting in a cause of 16 / Normal Call Clearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>contrib: Add systemd service and timer files for malloc trim.</h4>
<p>Service and timer files for systemd have been added to the
  contrib/systemd/ directory. If you are experiencing memory issues,
  install these files to have "malloc trim" periodically run on the
  system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Add log-caller-id-name option to log Caller ID Name in queue log</h4>
<p>This patch adds a global configuration option, log-caller-id-name, to queues.conf
  to control whether the Caller ID name is logged as parameter 4 when a call enters a queue.
  When log-caller-id-name=yes, the Caller ID name is included in the queue log,
  Any '|' characters in the caller ID name will be replaced with '_'.
  (provided it’s allowed by the existing log_restricted_caller_id rules).
  When log-caller-id-name=no (the default), the Caller ID name is omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>asterisk.c: Add "pre-init" and "pre-module" capability to cli.conf.</h4>
<p>In cli.conf, you can now define startup commands that run before
  core initialization and before module initialization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>audiosocket: added support for DTMF frames</h4>
<p>The AudioSocket protocol now forwards DTMF frames with
  payload type 0x03. The payload is a 1-byte ascii representing the DTMF
  digit (0-9,*,#...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ari/pjsip: Make it possible to control transfers through ARI</h4>
<p>Call transfers on the PJSIP channel can now be controlled by
  ARI. This can be enabled by using the PJSIP_TRANSFER_HANDLING(ari-only)
  dialplan function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Add Last Number Redial feature.</h4>
<p>Users can now redial the last number
  called if the lastnumredial setting is set to yes.
  Resolves: #437</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Add SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 as authentication digest algorithms</h4>
<p>The SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 algorithms are now available
  for authentication as both a UAS and a UAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Upgrade bundled pjproject to 2.15.1 Resolves: asterisk#1016</h4>
<p>Bundled pjproject has been upgraded to 2.15.1. For more
  information visit pjproject Github page: https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/releases/tag/2.15.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip: Add new AOR option "qualify_2xx_only"</h4>
<p>The pjsip.conf AOR section now has a "qualify_2xx_only"
  option that can be set so that only 2XX responses to OPTIONS requests
  used to qualify a contact will mark the contact as available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue: allow dynamically adding a queue member in paused state.</h4>
<p>use the p option of AddQueueMember() for paused member state.
  Optionally, use the r(reason) option to specify a custom reason for the pause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>manager.c: Add Processed Call Count to CoreStatus output</h4>
<p>The current processed call count is now returned as CoreProcessedCalls from the
  CoreStatus AMI Action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>func_curl.c: Add additional CURL options for SSL requests</h4>
<p>The following new configuration options are now available
  in the res_curl.conf file, and the CURL() function: 'ssl_verifyhost'
  (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST), 'ssl_cainfo' (CURLOPT_CAINFO), 'ssl_capath'
  (CURLOPT_CAPATH), 'ssl_cert' (CURLOPT_SSLCERT), 'ssl_certtype'
  (CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE), 'ssl_key' (CURLOPT_SSLKEY), 'ssl_keytype',
  (CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE) and 'ssl_keypasswd' (CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD). See the
  libcurl documentation for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stir_shaken: Allow sending Identity headers for unknown TNs</h4>
<p>You can now set the "unknown_tn_attest_level" option
  in the attestation and/or profile objects in stir_shaken.conf to
  enable sending Identity headers for callerid TNs not explicitly
  configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>manager.c: Restrict ListCategories to the configuration directory.</h4>
<p>The ListCategories AMI action now restricts files to the
  configured configuration directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip: Add new endpoint option "suppress_moh_on_sendonly"</h4>
<p>The new "suppress_moh_on_sendonly" endpoint option
  can be used to prevent playing MOH back to a caller if the remote
  end sends "sendonly" or "inactive" (hold) to Asterisk in an SDP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_mixmonitor: Add 'D' option for dual-channel audio.</h4>
<p>The MixMonitor application now has a new 'D' option which
  interleaves the recorded audio in the output frames. This allows for
  stereo recording output with one channel being the transmitted audio and
  the other being the received audio. The 't' and 't' options are
  compatible with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>manager.c: Restrict ModuleLoad to the configured modules directory.</h4>
<p>The ModuleLoad AMI action now restricts modules to the
  configured modules directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>manager: Enhance event filtering for performance</h4>
<p>You can now perform more granular filtering on events
  in manager.conf using expressions like
  <code>eventfilter(name(Newchannel),header(Channel),method(starts_with)) = PJSIP/</code>
  This is much more efficient than
  <code>eventfilter = Event: Newchannel.*Channel: PJSIP/</code>
  Full syntax guide is in configs/samples/manager.conf.sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>db.c: Remove limit on family/key length</h4>
<p>The <code>ast_db_*()</code> APIs have had the 253 byte limit on
  "/family/key" removed and will now accept families and keys with a
  total length of up to SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH (currently 1e9!).  This
  affects the <code>DB*</code> dialplan applications, dialplan functions,
  manager actions and <code>databse</code> CLI commands.  Since the
  media_cache also uses the <code>ast_db_*()</code> APIs, you can now store
  resources with URIs longer than 253 bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_notify: add dialplan application</h4>
<p>A new dialplan application PJSIPNotify is now available
  which can send SIP NOTIFY requests from the dialplan.
  The pjsip send notify CLI command has also been enhanced to allow
  sending NOTIFY messages to a specific channel. Syntax:
  pjsip send notify <option> channel <channel></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>channel: Add multi-tenant identifier.</h4>
<p>tenantid has been added to channels. It can be read in
  dialplan via CHANNEL(tenantid), and it can be set using
  Set(CHANNEL(tenantid)=My tenant ID). In pjsip.conf, it is recommended to
  use the new tenantid option for pjsip endpoints (e.g., tenantid=My
  tenant ID) so that it will show up in Newchannel events. You can set it
  like any other channel variable using set_var in pjsip.conf as well, but
  note that this will NOT show up in Newchannel events. Tenant ID is also
  available in CDR and can be accessed with CDR(tenantid). The peer tenant
  ID can also be accessed with CDR(peertenantid). CEL includes tenant ID
  as well if it has been set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>feat: ARI "ChannelToneDetected" event</h4>
<p>Setting the TONE_DETECT dialplan function on a channel
  in ARI will now cause a ChannelToneDetected ARI event to be raised
  when the specified tone is detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_config_wizard.c: Refactor load process</h4>
<p>The res_pjsip_config_wizard.so module can now be reloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_voicemail_odbc: Allow audio to be kept on disk</h4>
<p>This commit adds a new voicemail.conf option
  'odbc_audio_on_disk' which when set causes the ODBC variant of
  app_voicemail_odbc to leave the message and greeting audio files
  on disk and only store the message metadata in the database.
  Much more information can be found in the voicemail.conf.sample
  file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue:  Add option to not log Restricted Caller ID to queue_log</h4>
<p>Add a Queue option log-restricted-caller-id to control whether the Restricted Caller ID
  will be stored in the queue log.
  If log-restricted-caller-id=no then the Caller ID will be stripped if the Caller ID is restricted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>pbx.c: expand fields width of "core show hints"</h4>
<p>The fields width of "core show hints" were increased.
  The width of "extension" field to 30 characters and
  the width of the "device state id" field to 60 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>rtp_engine: add support for multirate RFC2833 digits</h4>
<p>No change in configuration is required in order to enable this
  feature. Endpoints configured to use RFC2833 will automatically have this
  enabled. If the endpoint does not support this, it should not include it in
  the SDP offer/response.
  Resolves: #699</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_logger: Preserve logging state on reloads.</h4>
<p>Issuing "pjsip reload" will no longer disable
  logging if it was previously enabled from the CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>loader.c: Allow dependent modules to be unloaded recursively.</h4>
<p>In certain circumstances, modules with dependency relations
  can have their dependents automatically recursively unloaded and loaded
  again using the "module refresh" CLI command or the ModuleLoad AMI command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>tcptls/iostream:  Add support for setting SNI on client TLS connections</h4>
<p>Secure websocket client connections now send SNI in
  the TLS client hello.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip: Endpoint identifier request URI</h4>
<p>this new feature let users match endpoints based on the
  indound SIP requests' URI. To do so, add 'request_uri' to the
  endpoint's 'identify_by' option. The 'match_request_uri' option of
  the identify can be an exact match for the entire request uri, or a
  regular expression (between slashes). It's quite similar to the
  header identifer.
  Fixes: #599</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_refer.c: Allow GET_TRANSFERRER_DATA</h4>
<p>the GET_TRANSFERRER_DATA dialplan variable can now be used also in pjsip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>manager.c: Add new parameter 'PreDialGoSub' to Originate AMI action</h4>
<p>When using the Originate AMI Action, we now can pass the PreDialGoSub parameter, instructing the asterisk to perform an subrouting at channel before call start. With this parameter an call initiated by AMI can request the channel to start the call automaticaly, adding a SIP header to using GoSUB, instructing to autoanswer the channel, and proceeding the outbuound extension executing. Exemple of an context to perform the previus indication:

  information on what all is included in this change, check out the
  pjproject Github page: https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/releases</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_speech_utils.c: Allow partial speech results.</h4>
<p>The SpeechBackground dialplan application now supports a 'p'
  option that will return partial results from speech engines that
  provide them when a timeout occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c: Add User-Agent header override</h4>
<p>PJSIP outbound registrations now support a per-registration
  User-Agent header</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_chanspy: Add 'D' option for dual-channel audio</h4>
<p>The ChanSpy application now accepts the 'D' option which
  will interleave the spied audio within the outgoing frames. The
  purpose of this is to allow the audio to be read as a Dual channel
  stream with separate incoming and outgoing audio. Setting both the
  'o' option and the 'D' option and results in the 'D' option being
  ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_voicemail_odbc: remove macrocontext from voicemail_messages table</h4>
<p>The fix requires removing the macrocontext column from the
  voicemail_messages table in the voicemail database via alembic upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Allow MWI to be manually toggled on channels.</h4>
<p>The 'dahdi set mwi' now allows MWI on channels
  to be manually toggled if needed for troubleshooting.
  Resolves: #440</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_dial: Add option "j" to preserve initial stream topology of caller</h4>
<p>The option "j" is now available for the Dial application which
  uses the initial stream topology of the caller to create the outgoing
  channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>logger: Add channel-based filtering.</h4>
<p>The console log can now be filtered by
  channels or groups of channels, using the
  logger filter CLI commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_pjsip: Add PJSIPHangup dialplan app and manager action</h4>
<p>A new dialplan app PJSIPHangup and AMI action allows you
  to hang up an unanswered incoming PJSIP call with a specific SIP
  response code in the 400 -&gt; 699 range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_voicemail: Add AMI event for mailbox PIN changes.</h4>
<p>The VoicemailPasswordChange event is
  now emitted whenever a mailbox password is updated,
  containing the mailbox information and the new
  password.
  Resolves: #398</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_speech: allow speech to translate input channel</h4>
<p>res_speech now supports translation of an input channel
  to a format supported by the speech provider, provided a translation
  path is available between the source format and provider capabilites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip: Expanding PJSIP endpoint ID and relevant resource length to 255 characters</h4>
<p>With this update, the PJSIP realm lengths have been extended
  to support up to 255 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stasis: signal when new command is queued</h4>
<p>Call setup times should be significantly improved
  when using ARI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>lock.c: Separate DETECT_DEADLOCKS from DEBUG_THREADS</h4>
<p>You no longer need to select DEBUG_THREADS to use
  DETECT_DEADLOCKS.  This removes a significant amount of overhead
  if you just want to detect possible deadlocks vs needing full
  lock tracing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>file.c: Add ability to search custom dir for sounds</h4>
<p>A new option "sounds_search_custom_dir" has been added to
  asterisk.conf that allows asterisk to search
  AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/custom for sounds files before searching the
  standard AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/<lang> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>make_buildopts_h, et. al.  Allow adding all cflags to buildopts.h</h4>
<p>The "Build Options" entry in the "core show settings"
  CLI command has been renamed to "ABI related Build Options" and
  a new entry named "All Build Options" has been added that shows
  both breaking and non-breaking options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_rtp: Implement RTP glue for UnicastRTP channels</h4>
<p>The dial string option 'g' was added to the UnicastRTP channel
  which enables RTP glue and therefore native RTP bridges with those
  channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>variables: Add additional variable dialplan functions.</h4>
<p>Four new dialplan functions have been added.
  GLOBAL_DELETE and DELETE have been added which allows
  the deletion of global and channel variables.
  GLOBAL_EXISTS and VARIABLE_EXISTS have been added
  which checks whether a global or channel variable has
  been set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Add Called Subscriber Held capability.</h4>
<p>Called Subscriber Held is now supported for analog
  FXS channels, using the calledsubscriberheld option. This allows
  a station  user to go on hook when receiving an incoming call
  and resume from another phone on the same line by going on hook,
  without disconnecting the call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip_header_funcs: Make prefix argument optional.</h4>
<p>The prefix argument to PJSIP_HEADERS is now
  optional. If not specified, all header names will be
  returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>core/ari/pjsip: Add refer mechanism</h4>
<p>There is a new ARI endpoint <code>/endpoints/refer</code> for referring
  an endpoint to some URI or endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Allow autoreoriginating after hangup.</h4>
<p>The autoreoriginate setting now allows for kewlstart FXS
  channels to automatically reoriginate and provide dial tone to the
  user again after all calls on the line have cleared. This saves users
  from having to manually hang up and pick up the receiver again before
  making another call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Allow three-way flash to time out to silence.</h4>
<p>The threewaysilenthold option now allows the three-way
  dial tone to time out to silence, rather than continuing forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip: Enable TLS v1.3 if present.</h4>
<p>res_pjsip now allows TLS v1.3 to be enabled if supported by
  the underlying PJSIP library. The bundled version of PJSIP supports
  TLS v1.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue: Add support for applying caller priority change immediately.</h4>
<p>The 'queue priority caller' CLI command and
  'QueueChangePriorityCaller' AMI action now have an 'immediate'
  argument which allows the caller priority change to be reflected
  immediately, causing the position of a caller to move within the
  queue depending on the priorities of the other callers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Adds manager actions to allow move/remove/forward individual messages in a particular mailbox folder. The forward command can be used to copy a message within a mailbox or to another mailbox. Also adds a VoicemailBoxSummarry, required to retrieve message ID's.</h4>
<p>The following manager actions have been added
  VoicemailBoxSummary - Generate message list for a given mailbox
  VoicemailRemove - Remove a message from a mailbox folder
  VoicemailMove - Move a message from one folder to another within a mailbox
  VoicemailForward - Copy a message from one folder in one mailbox
  to another folder in another or the same mailbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_voicemail: add CLI commands for message manipulation</h4>
<p>The following CLI commands have been added to app_voicemail
  voicemail show mailbox <mailbox> <context>
  Show contents of mailbox <mailbox>@<context>
  voicemail remove <mailbox> <context> <from_folder> <messageid>
  Remove message <messageid> from <from_folder> in mailbox <mailbox>@<context>
  voicemail move <mailbox> <context> <from_folder> <messageid> <to_folder>
  Move message <messageid> in mailbox <mailbox>&amp;<context> from <from_folder> to <to_folder>
  voicemail forward <from_mailbox> <from_context> <from_folder> <messageid> <to_mailbox> <to_context> <to_folder>
  Forward message <messageid> in mailbox <mailbox>@<context> <from_folder> to
  mailbox <mailbox>@<context> <to_folder></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Allow immediate fake ring to be suppressed.</h4>
<p>The immediatering option can now be set to no to suppress
  the fake audible ringback provided when immediate=yes on FXS channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>AMI: Add parking position parameter to Park action</h4>
<p>New ParkingSpace parameter has been added to AMI action Park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_musiconhold: Add option to loop last file.</h4>
<p>The loop_last option in musiconhold.conf now
  allows the last file in the directory to be looped once reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>AMI: Add CoreShowChannelMap action.</h4>
<p>New AMI action CoreShowChannelMap has been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>sig_analog: Add fuller Caller ID support.</h4>
<p>Additional Caller ID properties are now supported on
  incoming calls to FXS stations, namely the
  redirecting reason and call qualifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_stasis.c: Add new type 'sdp_label' for bridge creation.</h4>
<p>When creating a bridge using the ARI the 'type' argument now
  accepts a new value 'sdp_label' which will configure the bridge to add
  labels for each stream in the SDP with the corresponding channel id.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue: Preserve reason for realtime queues</h4>
<p>Make paused reason in realtime queues persist an
  Asterisk restart. This was fixed for non-realtime
  queues in ASTERISK_25732.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>cel: add local optimization begin event (#54)</h4>
<p>The new AST_CEL_LOCAL_OPTIMIZE_BEGIN can be used
  by itself or in conert with the existing
  AST_CEL_LOCAL_OPTIMIZE to book-end local channel optimizaion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Add dialmode option for FXS lines.</h4>
<p>A "dialmode" option has been added which allows
  specifying, on a per-channel basis, what methods of
  subscriber dialing (pulse and/or tone) are permitted.
  Additionally, this can be changed on a channel
  at any point during a call using the CHANNEL
  function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrade Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>http.c: Change httpstatus to default disabled and sanitize output.</h4>
<p>To prevent possible security issues, the <code>/httpstatus</code> page
  served by the internal web server is now disabled by default.  To explicitly
  enable it, set <code>enable_status=yes</code> in http.conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_geolocation:  Fix multiple issues with XML generation.</h4>
<p>Geolocation: In order to correct bugs in both code and
  documentation, the following changes to the parameters for GML geolocation
  locations are now in effect:</p>
</li>
<li>The documented but unimplemented <code>crs</code> (coordinate reference system) element
    has been added to the location_info parameter that indicates whether the <code>2d</code>
    or <code>3d</code> reference system is to be used. If the crs isn't valid for the shape
    specified, an error will be generated. The default depends on the shape
    specified.</li>
<li>The Circle, Ellipse and ArcBand shapes MUST use a <code>2d</code> crs.  If crs isn't
    specified, it will default to <code>2d</code> for these shapes.
    The Sphere, Ellipsoid and Prism shapes MUST use a <code>3d</code> crs. If crs isn't
    specified, it will default to <code>3d</code> for these shapes.
    The Point and Polygon shapes may use either crs.  The default crs is <code>2d</code>
    however so if <code>3d</code> positions are used, the crs must be explicitly set to <code>3d</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>geoloc show gml_shape_defs</code> CLI command has been updated to show which
    coordinate reference systems are valid for each shape.</li>
<li>The <code>pos3d</code> element has been removed in favor of allowing the <code>pos</code> element
    to include altitude if the crs is <code>3d</code>.  The number of values in the <code>pos</code>
    element MUST be 2 if the crs is <code>2d</code> and 3 if the crs is <code>3d</code>.  An error
    will be generated for any other combination.</li>
<li>
<p>The angle unit-of-measure for shapes that use angles should now be included
    in the respective parameter.  The default is <code>degrees</code>. There were some
    inconsistent references to <code>orientation_uom</code> in some documentation but that
    parameter never worked and is now removed.  See examples below.
  Examples...
  <code>location_info = shape="Sphere", pos="39.0 -105.0 1620", radius="20"
    location_info = shape="Point", crs="3d", pos="39.0 -105.0 1620"
    location_info = shape="Point", pos="39.0 -105.0"
    location_info = shape=Ellipsoid, pos="39.0 -105.0 1620", semiMajorAxis="20"
                  semiMinorAxis="10", verticalAxis="0", orientation="25 degrees"
    pidf_element_id = ${CHANNEL(name)}-${EXTEN}
    device_id = mac:001122334455
    Set(GEOLOC_PROFILE(pidf_element_id)=${CHANNEL(name)}/${EXTEN})</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_directed_pickup.c: Change some log messages from NOTICE to VERBOSE.</h4>
<p>In an effort to reduce log spam, two normal progress
  "pickup attempted" log messages from app_directed_pickup have been changed
  from NOTICE to VERBOSE(3).  This puts them on par with other normal
  dialplan progress messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue.c: Fix error in Queue parameter documentation.</h4>
<p>As part of Asterisk 21, macros were removed from Asterisk.
  This resulted in argument order changing for the Queue dialplan
  application since the macro argument was removed. Upgrade notice was
  missed when this was done, so this upgrade note has been added to
  provide a record of such and a notice to users who may have not upgraded
  yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_audiosocket: add message types for all slin sample rates</h4>
<p>New audiosocket message types 0x11 - 0x18 has been added
  for slin12, slin16, slin24, slin32, slin44, slin48, slin96, and
  slin192 audio. External applications using audiosocket may need to be
  updated to support these message types if the audiosocket channel is
  created with one of these audio formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>taskpool: Add taskpool API, switch Stasis to using it.</h4>
<p>The threadpool_* options in stasis.conf have now been deprecated
  though they continue to be read and used. They have been replaced with taskpool
  options that give greater control over the underlying taskpool used for stasis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>safe_asterisk: Add ownership checks for /etc/asterisk/startup.d and its files.</h4>
<p>The safe_asterisk script now checks that, if it was run by the
  root user, the /etc/asterisk/startup.d directory and all the files it contains
  are owned by root.  If the checks fail, safe_asterisk will exit with an error
  and Asterisk will not be started.  Additionally, the default logging
  destination is now stderr instead of tty "9" which probably won't exist
  in modern systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>jansson: Upgrade version to jansson 2.14.1</h4>
<p>jansson has been upgraded to 2.14.1. For more
  information visit jansson Github page: https://github.com/akheron/jansson/releases/tag/v2.14.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Alternate Channel Storage Backends</h4>
<p>With this release, you can now select an alternate channel
  storage backend based on C++ Maps.  Using the new backend may increase
  performance and reduce the chances of deadlocks on heavily loaded systems.
  For more information, see http://s.asterisk.net/dc679ec3</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ARI: REST over Websocket</h4>
<p>This commit adds the ability to make ARI REST requests over the same
  websocket used to receive events.
  See https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Interfaces/Asterisk-REST-Interface-ARI/ARI-REST-over-WebSocket/</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>alembic: Database updates required.</h4>
<p>Two commits in this release...
  'Add SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 as authentication digest algorithms'
  'res_pjsip: Add new AOR option "qualify_2xx_only"'
  ...have modified alembic scripts for the following database tables: ps_aors,
  ps_contacts, ps_auths, ps_globals. If you don't use the scripts to update
  your database, reads from those tables will succeeed but inserts into the
  ps_contacts table by res_pjsip_registrar will fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>channel: Add multi-tenant identifier.</h4>
<p>A new versioned struct (ast_channel_initializers) has been
  added that gets passed to __ast_channel_alloc_ap. The new function
  ast_channel_alloc_with_initializers should be used when creating
  channels that require the use of this struct. Currently the only value
  in the struct is for tenantid, but now more fields can be added to the
  struct as necessary rather than the __ast_channel_alloc_ap function. A
  new option (tenantid) has been added to endpoints in pjsip.conf as well.
  CEL has had its version bumped to include tenant ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue:  Add option to not log Restricted Caller ID to queue_log</h4>
<p>Add a new column to the queues table:
  queue_log_option_log_restricted ENUM('0','1','off','on','false','true','no','yes')
  to control whether the Restricted Caller ID will be stored in the queue log.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>pbx_variables.c: Prevent SEGV due to stack overflow.</h4>
<p>The maximum amount of dialplan recursion
  using variable substitution (such as by using EVAL_EXTEN)
  is capped at 15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Stir/Shaken Refactor</h4>
<p>The stir-shaken refactor is a breaking change but since
  it's not working now we don't think it matters. The
  stir_shaken.conf file has changed significantly which means that
  existing ones WILL need to be changed.  The stir_shaken.conf.sample
  file in configs/samples/ has quite a bit more information.  This is
  also an ABI breaking change since some of the existing objects
  needed to be changed or removed, and new ones added.  Additionally,
  if res_stir_shaken is enabled in menuselect, you'll need to either
  have the development package for libjwt v1.15.3 installed or use
  the --with-libjwt-bundled option with ./configure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_voicemail_odbc: remove macrocontext from voicemail_messages table</h4>
<p>The fix requires that the voicemail database be upgraded via
  alembic. Upgrading to the latest voicemail database via alembic will
  remove the macrocontext column from the voicemail_messages table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app.c: Allow ampersands in playback lists to be escaped.</h4>
<p>Ampersands in URLs passed to the <code>Playback()</code>,
  <code>Background()</code>, <code>SpeechBackground()</code>, <code>Read()</code>, <code>Authenticate()</code>, or
  <code>Queue()</code> applications as filename arguments can now be escaped by
  single quoting the filename. Additionally, this is also possible when
  using the <code>CONFBRIDGE</code> dialplan function, or configuring various
  features in <code>confbridge.conf</code> and <code>queues.conf</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>pjsip_configuration.c: Disable DTLS renegotiation if WebRTC is enabled.</h4>
<p>The dtls_rekey will be disabled if webrtc support is
  requested on an endpoint. A warning will also be emitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>res_pjsip: Expanding PJSIP endpoint ID and relevant resource length to 255 characters</h4>
<p>As part of this update, the maximum allowable length
  for PJSIP endpoints and relevant resources has been increased from
  40 to 255 characters. To take advantage of this enhancement, it is
  recommended to run the necessary procedures (e.g., Alembic) to
  update your schemas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>users.conf: Deprecate users.conf configuration.</h4>
<p>The users.conf config is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of Asterisk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_queue: Preserve reason for realtime queues</h4>
<p>Add a new column to the queue_member table:
  reason_paused VARCHAR(80) so the reason can be preserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>app_sla: Migrate SLA applications out of app_meetme.</h4>
<p>The SLAStation and SLATrunk applications have been moved
  from app_meetme to app_sla. If you are using these applications and have
  autoload=no, you will need to explicitly load this module in modules.conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>utils.h: Deprecate <code>ast_gethostbyname()</code>. (#79)</h4>
<p>ast_gethostbyname() has been deprecated and will be removed
  in Asterisk 23. New code should use <code>ast_sockaddr_resolve()</code> and
  <code>ast_sockaddr_resolve_first_af()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>cel: add local optimization begin event (#54)</h4>
<p>The existing AST_CEL_LOCAL_OPTIMIZE can continue
  to be used as-is and the AST_CEL_LOCAL_OPTIMIZE_BEGIN event
  can be ignored if desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Developer Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>ccss:  Add option to ccss.conf to globally disable it.</h4>
<p>A new API ast_is_cc_enabled() has been added.  It should be
  used to ensure that CCSS is enabled before making any other ast_cc_* calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_websocket: Add ability to place a MARK in the media stream.</h4>
<p>Apps can now send a <code>MARK_MEDIA</code> command with an optional
  <code>correlation_id</code> parameter to chan_websocket which will be placed in the
  media frame queue. When that frame is dequeued after all intervening media
  has been played to the core, chan_websocket will send a
  <code>MEDIA_MARK_PROCESSED</code> event to the app with the same correlation_id
  (if any).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_websocket: Add capability for JSON control messages and events.</h4>
<p>The chan_websocket plain-text control and event messages are now
  deprecated (but remain the default) in favor of JSON formatted messages.
  See https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Channel-Drivers/WebSocket for
  more information.
  A "transport_data" parameter has been added to the</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>chan_pjsip: Add technology-specific off-nominal hangup cause to events.</h4>
<p>A "tech_cause" parameter has been added to the
  ChannelHangupRequest and ChannelDestroyed ARI event messages and a "TechCause"
  parameter has been added to the HangupRequest, SoftHangupRequest and Hangup
  AMI event messages.  For chan_pjsip, these will be set to the last SIP
  response status code for off-nominally terminated calls.  The parameter is
  suppressed for nominal termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ARI: The bridges play and record APIs now handle sample rates &gt; 8K correctly.</h4>
<p>The ARI /bridges/play and /bridges/record REST APIs have new
  parameters that allow the caller to specify the format to be used on the
  "Announcer" and "Recorder" channels respecitvely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>taskpool: Add taskpool API, switch Stasis to using it.</h4>
<p>The taskpool API has been added for common usage of a
  pool of taskprocessors. It is suggested to use this API instead of the
  threadpool+taskprocessor approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ARI: Add command to indicate progress to a channel</h4>
<p>A new ARI endpoint is available at <code>/channels/{channelId}/progress</code> to indicate progress to a channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>options:  Change ast_options from ast_flags to ast_flags64.</h4>
<p>The 32-bit ast_options has no room left to accomodate new
  options and so has been converted to an ast_flags64 structure. All internal
  references to ast_options have been updated to use the 64-bit flag
  manipulation macros.  External module references to the 32-bit ast_options
  should continue to work on little-endian systems because the
  least-significant bytes of a 64 bit integer will be in the same location as a
  32-bit integer.  Because that's not the case on big-endian systems, we've
  swapped the bytes in the flags manupulation macros on big-endian systems
  so external modules should still work however you are encouraged to test.</p>

<h4>xml.c: Replace XML_PARSE_NOENT with XML_PARSE_NONET for xmlReadFile.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>The xmlReadFile XML_PARSE_NOENT flag, which allows parsing of external
  entities, could allow a potential XXE injection attack.  Replacing it with
  XML_PARSE_NONET, which prevents network access, is safer.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-85x7-54wr-vh42</p>
<h4>ast_coredumper: check ast_debug_tools.conf permissions</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>Prevent ast_coredumper from using ast_debug_tools.conf files that are
  not owned by root or are writable by other users or groups.</p>
<p>Prevent ast_logescalator and ast_loggrabber from doing the same if
  they are run as root.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-rvch-3jmx-3jf3</p>
<p>UserNote: ast_debug_tools.conf must be owned by root and not be
  writable by other users or groups to be used by ast_coredumper or
  by ast_logescalator or ast_loggrabber when run as root.</p>
<h4>http.c: Change httpstatus to default disabled and sanitize output.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>To address potential security issues, the httpstatus page is now disabled
  by default and the echoed query string and cookie output is html-escaped.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-v6hp-wh3r-cwxh</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: To prevent possible security issues, the <code>/httpstatus</code> page
  served by the internal web server is now disabled by default.  To explicitly
  enable it, set <code>enable_status=yes</code> in http.conf.</p>
<h4>ast_coredumper: create gdbinit file with restrictive permissions</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>Modify gdbinit to use the install command with explicit permissions (-m 600)
  when creating the .ast_coredumper.gdbinit file. This ensures the file is
  created with restricted permissions (readable/writable only by the owner)
  to avoid potential privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Resolves: #GHSA-xpc6-x892-v83c</p>
<h4>asterisk.c: Use C.UTF-8 locale instead of relying on user's environment.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2026-01-23</p>
<p>Resolves: #1739</p>
<h4>chan_websocket.conf.sample: Fix category name.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2026-01-21</p>
<p>UserNote: The category name in the chan_websocket.conf.sample file was
  incorrect.  It should be "global" instead of "general".</p>
<h4>chan_websocket: Fixed Ping/Pong messages hanging up the websocket channel</h4>
<p>Author: Joe Garlick
  Date:   2026-01-15</p>
<p>When chan_websocket received a Ping or a Pong opcode it would cause the channel to hangup. This change allows Ping/Pong opcodes and allows them to silently pass</p>
<h4>cli.c: Allow 'channel request hangup' to accept patterns.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2026-01-05</p>
<p>This extends 'channel request hangup' to accept multiple channel
  names, a POSIX Extended Regular Expression, a glob-like pattern, or a
  combination of all of them.</p>
<p>UserNote: The 'channel request hangup' CLI command now accepts
  multiple channel names, POSIX Extended Regular Expressions, glob-like
  patterns, or a combination of all of them. See the CLI command 'core
  show help channel request hangup' for full details.</p>
<h4>res_sorcery_memory_cache: Reduce cache lock time for sorcery memory cache populate command</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2026-01-06</p>
<p>Reduce cache lock time for AMI and CLI sorcery memory cache populate
  commands by adding a new populate_lock to the sorcery_memory_cache
  struct which is locked separately from the existing cache lock so that
  the cache lock can be maintained for a reduced time, locking only when
  the cache objects are removed and re-populated.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1700</p>
<p>UserNote: The AMI command sorcery memory cache populate will now
  return an error if there is an internal error performing the populate.
  The CLI command will display an error in this case as well.</p>
<h4>Add comment to asterisk.conf.sample clarifying that template sections are ignored</h4>

<p>Add comment to asterisk.conf.sample clarifying that template sections are ignored.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1692</p>
<h4>chan_websocket: Use the channel's ability to poll fds for the websocket read.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-12-30</p>
<p>We now add the websocket's file descriptor to the channel's fd array and let
  it poll for data availability instead if having a dedicated thread that
  does the polling. This eliminates the thread and allows removal of most
  explicit locking since the core channel code will lock the channel to prevent
  simultaneous calls to webchan_read, webchan_hangup, etc.</p>
<p>While we were here, the hangup code was refactored to use ast_hangup_with_cause
  instead of directly queueing an AST_CONTROL_HANGUP frame.  This allows us
  to set hangup causes and generate snapshots.</p>
<p>For a bit of extra debugging, a table of websocket close codes was added
  to http_websocket.h with an accompanying "to string" function added to
  res_http_websocket.c</p>
<p>Resolves: #1683</p>
<h4>asterisk.c: Allow multi-byte characters on the Asterisk CLI.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2025-12-13</p>
<p>Versions of libedit that support Unicode expect that the
  EL_GETCFN (the function that does character I/O) will fill in a
  <code>wchar_t</code> with a character, which may be multi-byte. The built-in
  function that libedit provides, but does not expose with a public API,
  does properly handle multi-byte sequences.</p>
<p>Due to the design of Asterisk's console processing loop, Asterisk
  provides its own implementation which does not handle multi-byte
  characters. Changing Asterisk to use libedit's built-in function would
  be ideal, but would also require changing some fundamental things
  about console processing which could be fairly disruptive.</p>
<p>Instead, we bring in libedit's <code>read_char</code> implementation and modify
  it to suit our specific needs.</p>
<p>Resolves: #60</p>
<h4>func_presencestate.c: Allow <code>NOT_SET</code> to be set from CLI.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright

<p>Resolves: #1647</p>
<h4>res/ari/resource_bridges.c: Normalize channel_format ref handling for bridge media</h4>
<p>Author: Peter Krall
  Date:   2025-12-17</p>
<p>Always take an explicit reference on the format used for bridge playback
  and recording channels, regardless of where it was sourced, and release
  it after prepare_bridge_media_channel. This aligns the code paths and
  avoids mixing borrowed and owned references while preserving behavior.</p>
<p>Fixes: #1648</p>
<h4>res_geolocation:  Fix multiple issues with XML generation.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-12-17</p>
<ul>
<li>3d positions were being rendered without an enclosing <code>&lt;gml:pos&gt;</code>
    element resulting in invalid XML.</li>
<li>There was no way to set the <code>id</code> attribute on the enclosing <code>tuple</code>, <code>device</code>
    and <code>person</code> elements.</li>
<li>There was no way to set the value of the <code>deviceID</code> element.</li>
<li>Parsing of degree and radian UOMs was broken resulting in them appearing
    outside an XML element.</li>
<li>The UOM schemas for degrees and radians were reversed.</li>
<li>The Ellipsoid shape was missing and the Ellipse shape was defined multiple
    times.</li>
<li>The <code>crs</code> location_info parameter, although documented, didn't work.</li>
<li>The <code>pos3d</code> location_info parameter appears in some documentation but
    wasn't being parsed correctly.</li>
<li>The retransmission-allowed and retention-expiry sub-elements of usage-rules
    were using the <code>gp</code> namespace instead of the <code>gbp</code> namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to fixing the above, several other code refactorings were
  performed and the unit test enhanced to include a round trip
  XML -&gt; eprofile -&gt; XML validation.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1667</p>
<p>UserNote: Geolocation: Two new optional profile parameters have been added.
  * <code>pidf_element_id</code> which sets the value of the <code>id</code> attribute on the top-level
    PIDF-LO <code>device</code>, <code>person</code> or <code>tuple</code> elements.
  * <code>device_id</code> which sets the content of the <code>&lt;deviceID&gt;</code> element.
  Both parameters can include channel variables.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: Geolocation: In order to correct bugs in both code and
  documentation, the following changes to the parameters for GML geolocation
  locations are now in effect:
  * The documented but unimplemented <code>crs</code> (coordinate reference system) element
    has been added to the location_info parameter that indicates whether the <code>2d</code>
    or <code>3d</code> reference system is to be used. If the crs isn't valid for the shape
    specified, an error will be generated. The default depends on the shape
    specified.
  * The Circle, Ellipse and ArcBand shapes MUST use a <code>2d</code> crs.  If crs isn't
    specified, it will default to <code>2d</code> for these shapes.
    The Sphere, Ellipsoid and Prism shapes MUST use a <code>3d</code> crs. If crs isn't
    specified, it will default to <code>3d</code> for these shapes.
    The Point and Polygon shapes may use either crs.  The default crs is <code>2d</code>
    however so if <code>3d</code> positions are used, the crs must be explicitly set to <code>3d</code>.
  * The <code>geoloc show gml_shape_defs</code> CLI command has been updated to show which
    coordinate reference systems are valid for each shape.
  * The <code>pos3d</code> element has been removed in favor of allowing the <code>pos</code> element
    to include altitude if the crs is <code>3d</code>.  The number of values in the <code>pos</code>
    element MUST be 2 if the crs is <code>2d</code> and 3 if the crs is <code>3d</code>.  An error
    will be generated for any other combination.
  * The angle unit-of-measure for shapes that use angles should now be included
    in the respective parameter.  The default is <code>degrees</code>. There were some
    inconsistent references to <code>orientation_uom</code> in some documentation but that
    parameter never worked and is now removed.  See examples below.
  Examples...
  <code>location_info = shape="Sphere", pos="39.0 -105.0 1620", radius="20"
    location_info = shape="Point", crs="3d", pos="39.0 -105.0 1620"
    location_info = shape="Point", pos="39.0 -105.0"
    location_info = shape=Ellipsoid, pos="39.0 -105.0 1620", semiMajorAxis="20"
                  semiMinorAxis="10", verticalAxis="0", orientation="25 degrees"
    pidf_element_id = ${CHANNEL(name)}-${EXTEN}
    device_id = mac:001122334455
    Set(GEOLOC_PROFILE(pidf_element_id)=${CHANNEL(name)}/${EXTEN})</code></p>
<h4>stasis/control.c: Add destructor to timeout_datastore.</h4>

<h4>configure.ac: use AC_PATH_TOOL for nm</h4>
<p>Author: Nathaniel Wesley Filardo
  Date:   2025-11-27</p>
<p><code>nm</code> might, especially in cross-compilation scenarios, be available but prefixed with the target triple. So: use <code>AC_PATH_TOOL</code> rather than <code>AC_PATH_PROG</code> to find it. (See https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.68/html_node/Generic-Programs.html .)</p>
<p>Found and proposed fix tested by cross-compiling Asterisk using Nixpkgs on x86_64 targeting aarch64. :)</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_mwi: Fix off-nominal endpoint ao2 ref leak in mwi_get_notify_data</h4>
<p>Author: Alexei Gradinari
  Date:   2025-12-29</p>
<p>Delay acquisition of the ast_sip_endpoint reference in mwi_get_notify_data()
  to avoid an ao2 ref leak on early-return error paths.</p>
<p>Move ast_sip_subscription_get_endpoint() to just before first use so all
  acquired references are properly cleaned up.</p>
<p>Fixes: #1675</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_messaging: Add support for following 3xx redirects</h4>
<p>Author: Maximilian Fridrich
  Date:   2025-11-07</p>
<p>This commit integrates the redirect module into res_pjsip_messaging
  to enable following 3xx redirect responses for outgoing SIP MESSAGEs.</p>
<p>When follow_redirect_methods contains 'message' on an endpoint, Asterisk
  will now follow 3xx redirect responses for MESSAGEs, similar to how
  it behaves for INVITE responses.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1576</p>
<p>UserNote: A new pjsip endpoint option follow_redirect_methods was added.
  This option is a comma-delimited, case-insensitive list of SIP methods
  for which SIP 3XX redirect responses are followed. An alembic upgrade
  script has been added for adding this new option to the Asterisk
  database.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip: Introduce redirect module for handling 3xx responses</h4>
<p>Author: Maximilian Fridrich
  Date:   2025-11-07</p>
<p>This commit introduces a new redirect handling module that provides
  infrastructure for following SIP 3xx redirect responses. The redirect
  functionality respects the endpoint's redirect_method setting and only
  follows redirects when set to 'uri_pjsip'. This infrastructure can be
  used by any PJSIP module that needs to handle 3xx redirect responses.</p>
<h4>app_mixmonitor.c: Fix crash in mixmonitor_ds_remove_and_free when datastore is NULL</h4>

<h4>res_pjsip_refer: don't defer session termination for ari transfer</h4>

<h4>chan_dahdi.conf.sample: Avoid warnings with default configs.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-10-23</p>
<p>callgroup and pickupgroup may only be specified for FXO-signaled channels;
  however, the chan_dahdi sample config had these options uncommented in
  the [channels] section, thus applying these settings to all channels,
  resulting in warnings. Comment these out so there are no warnings with
  an unmodified sample config.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1552</p>
<h4>main/dial.c: Set channel hangup cause on timeout in handle_timeout_trip</h4>
<p>Author: sarangr7
  Date:   2025-12-18</p>
<p>When dial attempts timeout in the core dialing API, the channel's hangup
  cause was not being set before hanging up. Only the ast_dial_channel
  structure's internal cause field was updated, but the actual ast_channel
  hangup cause remained unset.</p>
<p>This resulted in incorrect or missing hangup cause information being
  reported through CDRs, AMI events, and other mechanisms that read the
  channel's hangup cause when dial timeouts occurred via applications
  using the dialing API (FollowMe, Page, etc.).</p>
<p>The fix adds proper channel locking and sets AST_CAUSE_NO_ANSWER on
  the channel before calling ast_hangup(), ensuring consistent hangup
  cause reporting across all interfaces.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1660</p>
<h4>cel: Add missing manager documentation.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2025-12-12</p>
<p>The LOCAL_OPTIMIZE_BEGIN, STREAM_BEGIN, STREAM_END, and DTMF CEL

<h4>rtp/rtcp: Configure dual-stack behavior via IPV6_V6ONLY</h4>
<p>Author: Justin T. Gibbs
  Date:   2025-12-21</p>
<p>Dual-stack behavior (simultaneous listening for IPV4 and IPV6
  connections on a single socket) is required by Asterisk's ICE
  implementation.  On systems with the IPV6_V6ONLY sockopt, set
  the option to 0 (dual-stack enabled) when binding to the IPV6
  any address. This ensures correct behavior regardless of the
  system's default dual-stack configuration.</p>

<h4>chan_websocket: Add locking in send_event and check for NULL websocket handle.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-12-10</p>
<p>On an outbound websocket connection, when the triggering caller hangs up,
  webchan_hangup() closes the outbound websocket session and sets the websocket
  session handle to NULL.  If the hangup happened in the tiny window between
  opening the outbound websocket connection and before read_thread_handler()
  was able to send the MEDIA_START message, it could segfault because the
  websocket session handle was NULL.  If it didn't actually segfault, there was
  also the possibility that the websocket instance wouldn't get cleaned up which
  could also cause the channel snapshot to not get cleaned up.  That could
  cause memory leaks and <code>core show channels</code> to list phantom WebSocket
  channels.</p>
<p>To prevent the race, the send_event() macro now locks the websocket_pvt
  instance and checks the websocket session handle before attempting to send
  the MEDIA_START message.</p>

<h4>endpoint.c: Plug a memory leak in ast_endpoint_shutdown().</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-12-08</p>
<p>Commit 26795be introduced a memory leak of ast_endpoint when
  ast_endpoint_shutdown() was called. The leak occurs only if a configuration
  change removes an endpoint and isn't related to call volume or the length of
  time asterisk has been running.  An ao2_ref(-1) has been added to
  ast_endpoint_shutdown() to plug the leak.</p>

<h4>taskprocessors: Improve logging and add new cli options</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2025-10-28</p>
<p>This change makes some small changes to improve log readability in
  addition to the following changes:</p>
<p>Modified 'core show taskprocessors' to now show Low time and High time
  for task execution.</p>
<p>New command 'core show taskprocessor name <taskprocessor-name>' to dump
  taskprocessor info and current queue.</p>
<p>Addionally, a new test was added to demonstrate the 'show taskprocessor
  name' functionality:
  test execute category /main/taskprocessor/ name taskprocessor_cli_show</p>
<p>Setting 'core set debug 3 taskprocessor.c' will now log pushed tasks.
  (Warning this is will cause extremely high levels of logging at even
  low traffic levels.)</p>
<p>Resolves: #1566</p>
<p>UserNote: New CLI command has been added -
  core show taskprocessor name <taskprocessor-name></p>

<h4>ccss:  Add option to ccss.conf to globally disable it.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-11-19</p>
<p>The Call Completion Supplementary Service feature is rarely used but many of
  it's functions are called by app_dial and channel.c "just in case".  These
  functions lock and unlock the channel just to see if CCSS is enabled on it,
  which it isn't 99.99% of the time.</p>
<p>UserNote: A new "enabled" parameter has been added to ccss.conf.  It defaults
  to "yes" to preserve backwards compatibility but CCSS is rarely used so
  setting "enabled = no" in the "general" section can save some unneeded channel
  locking operations and log message spam.  Disabling ccss will also prevent
  the func_callcompletion and chan_dahdi modules from loading.</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: A new API ast_is_cc_enabled() has been added.  It should be
  used to ensure that CCSS is enabled before making any other ast_cc_* calls.</p>
<h4>app_directed_pickup.c: Change some log messages from NOTICE to VERBOSE.</h4>

<h4>app_reload: Fix Reload() without arguments.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-11-17</p>
<p>Calling Reload() without any arguments is supposed to reload
  everything (equivalent to a 'core reload'), but actually does
  nothing. This is because it was calling ast_module_reload with
  an empty string, and the argument needs to explicitly be NULL.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1597</p>
<h4>pbx.c: Print new context count when reloading dialplan.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-11-17</p>
<p>When running "dialplan reload", the number of contexts reported
  is initially wrong, as it is the old context count. Running
  "dialplan reload" a second time returns the correct number of
  contexts that are loaded. This can confuse users into thinking
  that the reload didn't work successfully the first time.</p>
<p>This counter is currently only incremented when iterating the
  old contexts prior to the context merge; at the very end, get
  the current number of elements in the context hash table and
  report that instead. This way, the count is correct immediately
  whenever a reload occurs.</p>

<h4>ast_coredumper: Fix multiple issues</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-11-07</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with tarball-coredumps when asterisk was invoked without an
  absolute path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with gdb itself segfaulting when trying to get symbols from
  separate debuginfo files.  The command line arguments needed to be altered
  such that the gdbinit files is loaded before anything else but the
  <code>dump-asterisk</code> command is run after full initialization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the embedded gdbinit script:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The extract_string_symbol function needed a <code>char *</code> cast to work properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The s_strip function needed to be updated to continue to work with the
  cpp_map_name_id channel storage backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new function was added to dump the channels when cpp_map_name_id was
  used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Channel object was updated to account for the new channel storage
  backends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The show_locks function was refactored to work correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>app_mixmonitor: Add 's' (skip) option to delay recording.</h4>
<p>Author: Daouda Taha
  Date:   2025-10-28</p>
<p>The 's' (skip) option delays MixMonitor recording until the specified number of seconds
  (can be fractional) have elapsed since MixMonitor was invoked.</p>
<p>No audio is written to the recording file during this time. If the call ends before this
  period, no audio will be saved. This is useful for avoiding early audio such as
  announcements, ringback tones, or other non-essential sounds.</p>
<p>UserNote: This change introduces a new 's(<seconds>)' (skip) option to the MixMonitor
  application. Example:
    MixMonitor(${UNIQUEID}.wav,s(3))</p>
<p>This skips recording for the first 3 seconds before writing audio to the file.
  Existing MixMonitor behavior remains unchanged when the 's' option is not used.</p>

<h4>chan_websocket: Add ability to place a MARK in the media stream.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-11-05</p>
<p>Also cleaned up a few unused #if blocks, and started sending a few ERROR
  events back to the apps.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1574</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: Apps can now send a <code>MARK_MEDIA</code> command with an optional
  <code>correlation_id</code> parameter to chan_websocket which will be placed in the
  media frame queue. When that frame is dequeued after all intervening media
  has been played to the core, chan_websocket will send a
  <code>MEDIA_MARK_PROCESSED</code> event to the app with the same correlation_id
  (if any).</p>
<h4>chan_websocket: Add capability for JSON control messages and events.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-10-22</p>
<p>With recent enhancements to chan_websocket, the original plain-text
  implementation of control messages and events is now too limiting.  We
  probably should have used JSON initially but better late than never.  Going
  forward, enhancements that require control message or event changes will
  only be done to the JSON variants and the plain-text variants are now
  deprecated but not yet removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the chan_websocket.conf config file that allows setting which control
  message format to use globally: "json" or "plain-text".  "plain-text" is the
  default for now to preserve existing behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a dialstring option <code>f(json|plain-text)</code> to allow the format to be
  overridden on a call-by-call basis.  Again, 'plain-text' is the default for
  now to preserve existing behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON for commands sent by the app to Asterisk must be...
  <code>{ "command": "&lt;command&gt;" ... }</code> where <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> is one of <code>ANSWER</code>, <code>HANGUP</code>,
  <code>START_MEDIA_BUFFERING</code>, etc.  The <code>STOP_MEDIA_BUFFERING</code> command takes an
  additional, optional parameter to be returned in the corresponding
  <code>MEDIA_BUFFERING_COMPLETED</code> event:
  <code>{ "command": "STOP_MEDIA_BUFFERING", "correlation_id": "&lt;correlation id&gt;" }</code>.</p>
<p>The JSON for events sent from Asterisk to the app will be...
  <code>{ "event": "&lt;event&gt;", "channel_id": "&lt;channel_id&gt;" ... }</code>.
  The <code>MEDIA_START</code> event will now look like...</p>
<p><code>{
    "event": "MEDIA_START",
    "connection_id": "media_connection1",
    "channel": "WebSocket/media_connection1/0x5140001a0040",
    "channel_id": "1761245643.1",
    "format": "ulaw",
    "optimal_frame_size": 160,
    "ptime": 20,
    "channel_variables": {
      "DIALEDPEERNUMBER": "media_connection1/c(ulaw)",
      "MEDIA_WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION_ID": "media_connection1",
      "MEDIA_WEBSOCKET_OPTIMAL_FRAME_SIZE": "160"
    }
  }</code></p>
<p>Note the addition of the channel variables which can't be supported
  with the plain-text formatting.</p>
<p>The documentation will be updated with the exact formats for all commands
  and events.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1546
  Resolves: #1563</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: The chan_websocket plain-text control and event messages are now
  deprecated (but remain the default) in favor of JSON formatted messages.
  See https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Channel-Drivers/WebSocket for
  more information.</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: A "transport_data" parameter has been added to the
  channels/externalMedia ARI endpoint which, for websocket, allows the caller
  to specify parameters to be added to the dialstring for the channel.  For
  instance, <code>"transport_data": "f(json)"</code>.</p>
<h4>build: Add menuselect options to facilitate code tracing and coverage</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-10-30</p>
<p>The following options have been added to the menuselect "Compiler Flags"
  section...</p>
<p>CODE_COVERAGE: The ability to enable code coverage via the <code>--enable-coverage</code>
  configure flag has existed for many years but changing it requires
  re-running ./configure which is painfully slow.  With this commit, you can
  now enable and disable it via menuselect. Setting this option adds the
  <code>-ftest-coverage</code> and <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> flags on the gcc and ld command lines.
  It also sets DONT_OPTIMIZE. Note: If you use the <code>--enable-coverage</code> configure
  flag, you can't turn it off via menuselect so choose one method and stick to
  it.</p>
<p>KEEP_FRAME_POINTERS: This option sets <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointers</code> on the gcc
  command line which can facilitate debugging with 'gdb' and tracing with 'perf'.
  Unlike CODE_COVERAGE, this option doesn't depend on optimization being
  disabled.  It does however conflict with COMPILE_DOUBLE.</p>
<h4>channelstorage:  Allow storage driver read locking to be skipped.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-11-06</p>
<p>After PR #1498 added read locking to channelstorage_cpp_map_name_id, if ARI
  channels/externalMedia was called with a custom channel id AND the
  cpp_map_name_id channel storage backend is in use, a deadlock can occur when
  hanging up the channel. It's actually triggered in
  channel.c:__ast_channel_alloc_ap() when it gets a write lock on the
  channelstorage driver then subsequently does a lookup for channel uniqueid
  which now does a read lock. This is an invalid operation and causes the lock
  state to get "bad". When the channels try to hang up, a write lock is
  attempted again which hangs and causes the deadlock.</p>
<p>Now instead of the cpp_map_name_id channelstorage driver "get" APIs
  automatically performing a read lock, they take a "lock" parameter which
  allows a caller who already has a write lock to indicate that the "get" API
  must not attempt its own lock.  This prevents the state from getting mesed up.</p>
<p>The ao2_legacy driver uses the ao2 container's recursive mutex so doesn't
  have this issue but since it also implements the common channelstorage API,
  it needed its "get" implementations updated to take the lock parameter. They
  just don't use it.</p>

<h4>res_audiosocket: fix temporarily unavailable</h4>
<p>Author: Roman Pertsev
  Date:   2025-10-07</p>
<p>Operations on non-blocking sockets may return a resource temporarily unavailable error (EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK). This is not a fatal error but a normal condition indicating that the operation would block.</p>
<p>This patch corrects the handling of this case. Instead of incorrectly treating it as a reason to terminate the connection, the code now waits for data to arrive on the socket.</p>

<h4>Fix Endianness detection in utils.h for non-Linux</h4>
<p>Author: Christoph Moench-Tegeder
  Date:   2025-10-19</p>
<p>Commit 43bf8a4ded7a65203b766b91eaf8331a600e9d8d introduced endian
  dependend byte-swapping code in include/asterisk/utils.h, where the
  endianness was detected using the __BYTE_ORDER macro. This macro
  lives in endian.h, which on Linux is included implicitely (by the
  network-related headers, I think), but on FreeBSD the headers are
  laid out differently and we do not get __BYTE_ORDER the implicit way.</p>
<p>Instead, this makes the usage of endian.h explicit by including it
  where we need it, and switches the BYTE_ORDER/*ENDIAN macros to the
  POSIX-defined ones (see
  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/endian.h.html
  for standard compliance). Additionally, this adds a compile-time check
  for the endianness-logic: compilation will fail if neither big nor
  little endian can be detected.</p>
<p>Fixes: #1536</p>
<h4>app_queue.c: Fix error in Queue parameter documentation.</h4>
<p>Author: Ben Ford
  Date:   2025-10-20</p>
<p>When macro was removed in Asterisk 21, the parameter documentation in
  code was not updated to reflect the correct numerization for gosub. It
  still stated that it was the seventh parameter, but got shifted to the
  sixth due to the removal of macro. This has been updated to correctly
  reflect the parameter order, and a note has been added to the XML that
  states this was done after the initial commit.</p>
<p>Fixes: #1534</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: As part of Asterisk 21, macros were removed from Asterisk.
  This resulted in argument order changing for the Queue dialplan
  application since the macro argument was removed. Upgrade notice was
  missed when this was done, so this upgrade note has been added to
  provide a record of such and a notice to users who may have not upgraded
  yet.</p>
<h4>devicestate: Don't publish redundant device state messages.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-10-17</p>
<p>When publishing device state check the local cache for the
  existing device state. If the new device state is unchanged
  from the prior one, don't bother publishing the update. This
  can reduce the work done by consumers of device state, such
  as hints and app_queue, by not publishing a message to them.</p>
<p>These messages would most often occur with devices that are
  seeing numerous simultaneous channels. The underlying device
  state would remain as in use throughout, but an update would
  be published as channels are created and hung up.</p>
<h4>chan_pjsip: Add technology-specific off-nominal hangup cause to events.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-10-14</p>
<p>Although the ISDN/Q.850/Q.931 hangup cause code is already part of the ARI
  and AMI hangup and channel destroyed events, it can be helpful to know what
  the actual channel technology code was if the call was unsuccessful.
  For PJSIP, it's the SIP response code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new "tech_hangupcause" field was added to the ast_channel structure along
  with ast_channel_tech_hangupcause() and ast_channel_tech_hangupcause_set()
  functions.  It should only be set for off-nominal terminations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chan_pjsip was modified to set the tech hangup cause in the
  chan_pjsip_hangup() and chan_pjsip_session_end() functions.  This is a bit
  tricky because these two functions aren't always called in the same order.
  The channel that hangs up first will get chan_pjsip_session_end() called
  first which will trigger the core to call chan_pjsip_hangup() on itself,
  then call chan_pjsip_hangup() on the other channel.  The other channel's
  chan_pjsip_session_end() function will get called last.  Unfortunately,
  the other channel's HangupRequest events are sent before chan_pjsip has had a
  chance to set the tech hangupcause code so the HangupRequest events for that
  channel won't have the cause code set.  The ChannelDestroyed and Hangup
  events however will have the code set for both channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new "tech_cause" field was added to the ast_channel_snapshot_hangup
  structure. This is a public structure so a bit of refactoring was needed to
  preserve ABI compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ARI ChannelHangupRequest and ChannelDestroyed events were modified to
  include the "tech_cause" parameter in the JSON for off-nominal terminations.
  The parameter is suppressed for nominal termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AMI SoftHangupRequest, HangupRequest and Hangup events were modified to
  include the "TechCause" parameter for off-nominal terminations. Like their ARI
  counterparts, the parameter is suppressed for nominal termination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DeveloperNote: A "tech_cause" parameter has been added to the
  ChannelHangupRequest and ChannelDestroyed ARI event messages and a "TechCause"
  parameter has been added to the HangupRequest, SoftHangupRequest and Hangup
  AMI event messages.  For chan_pjsip, these will be set to the last SIP
  response status code for off-nominally terminated calls.  The parameter is
  suppressed for nominal termination.</p>
<h4>res_audiosocket: add message types for all slin sample rates</h4>
<p>Author: Sven Kube
  Date:   2025-10-10</p>
<p>Extend audiosocket messages with types 0x11 - 0x18 to create asterisk
  frames in slin12, slin16, slin24, slin32, slin44, slin48, slin96, and
  slin192 format, enabling the transmission of audio at a higher sample
  rates. For audiosocket messages sent by Asterisk, the message kind is

<h4>res_fax.c: lower FAXOPT read warning to debug level</h4>
<p>Author: phoneben

<p>Reading ${FAXOPT()} before a fax session is common in dialplans to check fax state.
  Currently this logs an error even when no fax datastore exists, creating excessive noise.
  Change these messages to ast_debug(3, …) so they appear only with debug enabled.</p>

<h4>endpoints: Remove need for stasis subscription.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-10-10</p>
<p>When an endpoint is created in the core of Asterisk a subscription
  was previously created alongside it to monitor any channels being
  destroyed that were related to it. This was done by receiving all
  channel snapshot updates for every channel and only reacting when
  it was indicated that the channel was dead.</p>
<p>This change removes this logic and instead provides an API call
  for directly removing a channel from an endpoint. This is called
  when channels are destroyed. This operation is fast, so blocking
  the calling thread for a short period of time doesn't have any
  noticeable impact.</p>
<h4>app_queue: Allow stasis message filtering to work.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-10-10</p>
<p>The app_queue module subscribes on a per-dialed agent basis to both
  the bridge all and channel all topics to keep apprised of things going
  on involving them. This subscription has associated state that must
  be cleaned up when the subscription ends. This was done by setting
  a default router callback that only had logic to handle the case
  where the subscription ends. By using the default router callback
  all filtering for the subscription was disabled, causing unrelated
  messages to get published and handled by it.</p>
<p>This change makes it so that an explicit route is added for the
  message type used for the message indicating the subscription has
  ended and removes the default router callback. This allows message
  filtering to occur on publishing reducing the messages to app_queue
  to only those it is interested in.</p>

<h4>func_hangupcause.c: Add access to Reason headers via HANGUPCAUSE()</h4>

<p>As soon as SIP call may end with several Reason headers, we
  want to make all of them available through the HAGUPCAUSE() function.
  This implementation uses the same ao2 hash for cause codes storage
  and adds a flag to make difference between last processed sip
  message and content of reason headers.</p>
<p>UserNote: Added a new option to HANGUPCAUSE to access additional
  information about hangup reason. Reason headers from pjsip
  could be read using 'tech_extended' cause type.</p>
<h4>sig_analog: Allow '#' to end the inter-digit timeout when dialing.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-10-03</p>
<p>It is customary to allow # to terminate digit collection immediately
  when there would normally be a timeout. However, currently, users are
  forced to wait for the timeout to expire when dialing numbers that
  are prefixes of other valid matches, and there is no way to end the
  timeout early. Customarily, # terminates the timeout, but at the moment,
  this is just rejected unless there happens to be a matching extension
  ending in #.</p>
<p>Allow # to terminate the timeout in cases where there is no dialplan
  match. This ensures that the dialplan is always respected, but if a
  valid extension has been dialed that happens to prefix other valid
  matches, # can be used to dial it immediately.</p>

<p>Author: George Joseph

<p>When we retrieve a channel from a C++ map, we actually get back a wrapper
  object that points to the channel then right after we retrieve it, we bump its
  reference count.  There's a tiny chance however that between those two

  object or the channel itself to become invalid resulting in a SEGV.  To avoid
  this we now perform a read lock on the driver around those statements.</p>

<p>If Last Number Redial is used to redial, ensure that we do not wait
  for further digits. This was possible if the number that was last
  dialed is a prefix of another possible dialplan match. Since all we
  did is copy the number into the extension buffer, if other matches
  are now possible, there would thus be a timeout before the call went
  through. We now complete redialed calls immediaetly in all cases.</p>

<h4>ARI: The bridges play and record APIs now handle sample rates &gt; 8K correctly.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-09-25</p>
<p>The bridge play and record APIs were forcing the Announcer/Recorder channel
  to slin8 which meant that if you played or recorded audio with a sample
  rate &gt; 8K, it was downsampled to 8K limiting the bandwidth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The /bridges/play REST APIs have a new "announcer_format" parameter that
    allows the caller to explicitly set the format on the "Announcer" channel
    through which the audio is played into the bridge.  If not specified, the
    default depends on how many channels are currently in the bridge.  If
    a single channel is in the bridge, then the Announcer channel's format
    will be set to the same as that channel's.  If multiple channels are in the
    bridge, the channels will be scanned to find the one with the highest
    sample rate and the Announcer channel's format will be set to the slin
    format that has an equal to or greater than sample rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The /bridges/record REST API has a new "recorder_format" parameter that
    allows the caller to explicitly set the format on the "Recorder" channel
    from which audio is retrieved to write to the file.  If not specified,
    the Recorder channel's format will be set to the format that was requested
    to save the audio in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolves: #1479</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: The ARI /bridges/play and /bridges/record REST APIs have new
  parameters that allow the caller to specify the format to be used on the
  "Announcer" and "Recorder" channels respecitvely.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_geolocation: Add support for Geolocation loc-src parameter</h4>
<p>Author: Max Grobecker

<p>This adds support for the Geolocation 'loc-src' parameter to res_pjsip_geolocation.
  The already existing config option 'location_source` in res_geolocation is documented to add a 'loc-src' parameter containing a user-defined FQDN to the 'Geolocation:' header,

<h4>taskpool: Update versions for taskpool stasis options.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-09-16</p>
<h4>taskpool: Add taskpool API, switch Stasis to using it.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-08-06</p>
<p>This change introduces a new API called taskpool. This is a pool
  of taskprocessors. It provides the following functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>Task pushing to a pool of taskprocessors</li>
<li>Synchronous tasks</li>
<li>Serializers for execution ordering of tasks</li>
<li>Growing/shrinking of number of taskprocessors in pool</li>
</ol>
<p>This functionality already exists through the combination of
  threadpool+taskprocessors but through investigating I determined
  that this carries substantial overhead for short to medium duration
  tasks. The threadpool uses a single queue of work, and for management
  of threads it involves additional tasks.</p>
<p>I wrote taskpool to eliminate the extra overhead and management
  as much as possible. Instead of a single queue of work each
  taskprocessor has its own queue and at push time a selector chooses
  the taskprocessor to queue the task to. Each taskprocessor also
  has its own thread like normal. This spreads out the tasks immediately
  and reduces contention on shared resources.</p>
<p>Using the included efficiency tests the number of tasks that can be
  executed per second in a taskpool is 6-12 times more than an equivalent
  threadpool+taskprocessor setup.</p>
<p>Stasis has been moved over to using this new API as it is a heavy consumer
  of threadpool+taskprocessors and produces a lot of tasks.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: The threadpool_* options in stasis.conf have now been deprecated
  though they continue to be read and used. They have been replaced with taskpool
  options that give greater control over the underlying taskpool used for stasis.</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: The taskpool API has been added for common usage of a
  pool of taskprocessors. It is suggested to use this API instead of the
  threadpool+taskprocessor approach.</p>

<h4>pbx_variables.c: Create real channel for "dialplan eval function".</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-09-09</p>
<p>"dialplan eval function" has been using a dummy channel for function
  evaluation, much like many of the unit tests. However, sometimes, this
  can cause issues for functions that are not expecting dummy channels.
  As an example, ast_channel_tech(chan) is NULL on such channels, and
  ast_channel_tech(chan)-&gt;type consequently results in a NULL dereference.
  Normally, functions do not worry about this since channels executing
  dialplan aren't dummy channels.</p>
<p>While some functions are better about checking for these sorts of edge
  cases, use a real channel with a dummy technology to make this CLI
  command inherently safe for any dialplan function that could be evaluated
  from the CLI.</p>

<h4>chan_websocket: Fix codec validation and add passthrough option.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-09-17</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in webchan_write() where we weren't detecting equivalent
    codecs properly.</li>
<li>Added the "p" dialstring option that puts the channel driver in
    "passthrough" mode where it will not attempt to re-frame or re-time
    media coming in over the websocket from the remote app.  This can be used
    for any codec but MUST be used for codecs that use packet headers or whose
    data stream can't be broken up on arbitrary byte boundaries. In this case,
    the remote app is fully responsible for correctly framing and timing media
    sent to Asterisk and the MEDIA text commands that could be sent over the
    websocket are disabled.  Currently, passthrough mode is automatically set
    for the opus, speex and g729 codecs.</li>
<li>Now calling ast_set_read_format() after ast_channel_set_rawreadformat() to
    ensure proper translation paths are set up when switching between native
    frames and slin silence frames.  This fixes an issue with codec errors
    when transcode_via_sln=yes.</li>

<h4>res_tonedetect: Add option for TONE_DETECT detection to auto stop.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-08-22</p>
<p>One of the problems with TONE_DETECT as it was originally written
  is that if a tone is detected multiple times, it can trigger
  the redirect logic multiple times as well. For example, if we
  do an async goto in the dialplan after detecting a tone, because
  the detector is still active until explicitly disabled, if we
  detect the tone again, we will branch again and start executing
  that dialplan a second time. This is rarely ever desired behavior,
  and can happen if the detector is not removed quickly enough.</p>
<p>Add a new option, 'e', which automatically disables the detector
  once the desired number of matches have been heard. This eliminates
  the potential race condition where previously the detector would
  need to be disabled immediately, but doing so quickly enough
  was not guaranteed. This also allows match criteria to be retained
  longer if needed, so the detector does not need to be destroyed
  prematurely.</p>
<p>Resolves: #1390</p>
<p>UserNote: The 'e' option for TONE_DETECT now allows detection to
  be disabled automatically once the desired number of matches have
  been fulfilled, which can help prevent race conditions in the
  dialplan, since TONE_DETECT does not need to be disabled after
  a hit.</p>

<h4>sorcery: Prevent duplicate objects and ensure missing objects are created on update</h4>
<p>Author: Alexei Gradinari
  Date:   2025-07-07</p>
<p>This patch resolves two issues in Sorcery objectset handling with multiple
  backends:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prevent duplicate objects:
     When an object exists in more than one backend (e.g., a contact in both
     'astdb' and 'realtime'), the objectset previously returned multiple instances
     of the same logical object. This caused logic failures in components like the
     PJSIP registrar, where duplicate contact entries led to overcounting and
     incorrect deletions, when max_contacts=1 and remove_existing=yes.</p>
<p>This patch ensures only one instance of an object with a given key is added
 to the objectset, avoiding these duplicate-related side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure missing objects are created:
     When using multiple writable backends, a temporary backend failure can lead
     to objects missing permanently from that backend.
     Currently, .update() silently fails if the object is not present,
     and no .create() is attempted.
     This results in inconsistent state across backends (e.g. astdb vs. realtime).</p>
<p>This patch introduces a new global option in sorcery.conf:
   [general]
   update_or_create_on_update_miss = yes|no</p>
<p>Default: no (preserves existing behavior).</p>
<p>When enabled: if .update() fails with no data found, .create() is attempted
 in that backend. This ensures that objects missing due to temporary backend
 outages are re-synchronized once the backend is available again.</p>
<p>Added a new CLI command:
   sorcery show settings
 Displays global Sorcery settings, including the current value of
 update_or_create_on_update_miss.</p>
<p>Updated tests to validate both flag enabled/disabled behavior.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixes: #1289</p>
<p>UserNote: Users relying on Sorcery multiple writable backends configurations
  (e.g., astdb + realtime) may now enable update_or_create_on_update_miss = yes
  in sorcery.conf to ensure missing objects are recreated after temporary backend
  failures. Default behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly enabled.</p>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Fix erroneously persistent dialmode.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-08-18</p>
<p>It is possible to modify the dialmode setting in the chan_dahdi/sig_analog
  private using the CHANNEL function, to modify it during calls. However,
  it was not being reset between calls, meaning that if, for example, tone
  dialing was disabled, it would never work again unless explicitly enabled.</p>
<p>This fixes the setting by pairing it with a "perm" version of the setting,
  as a few other features have, so that it can be reset to the permanent
  setting between calls. The documentation is also clarified to explain
  the interaction of this setting and the digitdetect setting more clearly.</p>

<h4>chan_websocket: Allow additional URI parameters to be added to the outgoing URI.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-08-13</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new option to the WebSocket dial string to capture the additional
    URI parameters.</li>
<li>Added a new API ast_uri_verify_encoded() that verifies that a string
    either doesn't need URI encoding or that it has already been encoded.</li>
<li>Added a new API ast_websocket_client_add_uri_params() to add the params
    to the client websocket session.</li>
<li>Added XML documentation that will show up with <code>core show application Dial</code>
    that shows how to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolves: #1352</p>
<p>UserNote: A new WebSocket channel driver option <code>v</code> has been added to the
  Dial application that allows you to specify additional URI parameters on
  outgoing connections. Run <code>core show application Dial</code> from the Asterisk CLI
  to see how to use it.</p>
<h4>chan_websocket: Fix buffer overrun when processing TEXT websocket frames.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-08-19</p>
<p>ast_websocket_read() receives data into a fixed 64K buffer then continually
  reallocates a final buffer that, after all continuation frames have been
  received, is the exact length of the data received and returns that to the
  caller.  process_text_message() in chan_websocket was attempting to set a
  NULL terminator on the received payload assuming the payload buffer it
  received was the large 64K buffer.  The assumption was incorrect so when it
  tried to set a NULL terminator on the payload, it could, depending on the
  state of the heap at the time, cause heap corruption.</p>
<p>process_text_message() now allocates its own payload_len + 1 sized buffer,
  copies the payload received from ast_websocket_read() into it then NULL
  terminates it prevent the possibility of the overrun and corruption.</p>

<h4>dsp.c: Improve debug logging in tone_detect().</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-08-15</p>
<p>The debug logging during DSP processing has always been kind
  of overwhelming and annoying to troubleshoot. Simplify and
  improve the logging in a few ways to aid DSP debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we had a DSP hit, don't also emit the previous debug message that
    was always logged. It is duplicated by the hit message, so this can
    reduce the number of debug messages during detection by 50%.</li>
<li>Include the hit count and required number of hits in the message so
    on partial detections can be more easily troubleshot.</li>
<li>Use debug level 9 for hits instead of 10, so we can focus on hits
    without all the noise from the per-frame debug message.</li>
<li>1-index the hit count in the debug messages. On the first hit, it
    currently logs '0', just as when we are not detecting anything,
    which can be confusing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>xmldoc.c: Fix rendering of CLI output.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-08-14</p>
<p>If you do a <code>core show application Dial</code>, you'll see it's kind of a mess.
  Indents are wrong is some places, examples are printed in black which makes
  them invisible on most terminals, and the lack of line breaks in some cases
  makes it hard to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the rendering of examples so they are indented properly and changed
  the color so they can be seen.</li>
<li>There is now a line break before each option.</li>
<li>Options are now printed on their own line with all option content indented
  below them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example from Dial before fixes:

<ul>
<li>
<p>With <mode> set to '2', when the operator flashes the trunk, it will ring
   their phone back.
  Enables <em>operator services</em> mode.  This option only works when bridging a DAHDI
  channel to another DAHDI channel only. If specified on non-DAHDI interfaces, it
  will be ignored. When the destination answers (presumably an operator services
  station), the originator no longer has control of their line. They may hang up,
  but the switch will not release their line until the destination party (the
  operator) hangs up.</p>

<h4>pbx_lua.c: segfault when pass null data to term_color function</h4>
<p>Author: Alexey Khabulyak
  Date:   2025-08-14</p>
<p>This can be reproduced under certain curcomstences.
  For example: call app.playback from lua with invalid data: app.playback({}).
  pbx_lua.c will try to get data for this playback using lua_tostring function.
  This function returs NULL for everything but strings and numbers.
  Then, it calls term_color with NULL data.
  term_color function can call(if we don't use vt100 compat term)
  ast_copy_string with NULL inbuf which cause segfault. bt example:
  ast_copy_string (size=8192, src=0x0, dst=0x7fe44b4be8b0)

<h4>channelstorage_cpp_map_name_id.cc: Refactor iterators for thread-safety.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-07-30</p>
<p>The fact that deleting an object from a map invalidates any iterator
  that happens to currently point to that object was overlooked in the initial
  implementation.  Unfortunately, there's no way to detect that an iterator
  has been invalidated so the result was an occasional SEGV triggered by modules
  like app_chanspy that opens an iterator and can keep it open for a long period
  of time.  The new implementation doesn't keep the underlying C++ iterator
  open across calls to ast_channel_iterator_next() and uses a read lock
  on the map to ensure that, even for the few microseconds we use the
  iterator, another thread can't delete a channel from under it.  Even with
  this change, the iterators are still WAY faster than the ao2_legacy
  storage driver.</p>
<p>Full details about the new implementation are located in the comments for
  iterator_next() in channelstorage_cpp_map_name_id.cc.</p>

<h4>options:  Change ast_options from ast_flags to ast_flags64.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-07-21</p>
<p>DeveloperNote: The 32-bit ast_options has no room left to accomodate new
  options and so has been converted to an ast_flags64 structure. All internal
  references to ast_options have been updated to use the 64-bit flag
  manipulation macros.  External module references to the 32-bit ast_options
  should continue to work on little-endian systems because the
  least-significant bytes of a 64 bit integer will be in the same location as a
  32-bit integer.  Because that's not the case on big-endian systems, we've
  swapped the bytes in the flags manupulation macros on big-endian systems
  so external modules should still work however you are encouraged to test.</p>
<h4>res_config_odbc: Prevent Realtime fallback on record-not-found (SQL_NO_DATA)</h4>
<p>Author: Alexei Gradinari
  Date:   2025-07-15</p>
<p>This patch fixes an issue in the ODBC Realtime engine where Asterisk incorrectly
  falls back to the next configured backend when the current one returns
  SQL_NO_DATA (i.e., no record found).
  This is a logical error and performance risk in multi-backend configurations.</p>
<p>Solution:
  Introduced CONFIG_RT_NOT_FOUND ((void *)-1) as a special return marker.
  ODBC Realtime backend now return CONFIG_RT_NOT_FOUND when no data is found.
  Core engine stops iterating on this marker, avoiding unnecessary fallback.</p>
<p>Notes:
  Other Realtime backends (PostgreSQL, LDAP, etc.) can be updated similarly.
  This patch only covers ODBC.</p>

<h4>chan_websocket: Reset frame_queue_length to 0 after FLUSH_MEDIA</h4>
<p>Author: kodokaii
  Date:   2025-07-03</p>
<p>In the WebSocket channel driver, the FLUSH_MEDIA command clears all frames from
  the queue but does not reset the frame_queue_length counter.</p>
<p>As a result, the driver incorrectly thinks the queue is full after flushing,
  which prevents new multimedia frames from being sent, especially after multiple
  flush commands.</p>
<p>This fix sets frame_queue_length to 0 after flushing, ensuring the queue state
  is consistent with its actual content.</p>

<h4>chan_pjsip.c: Change SSRC after media source change</h4>
<p>Author: Martin Tomec
  Date:   2025-06-25</p>
<p>When the RTP media source changes, such as after a blind transfer, the new source introduces a discontinuous timestamp. According to RFC 3550, Section 5.1, an RTP stream's timestamp for a given SSRC must increment monotonically and linearly.
  To comply with the standard and avoid a large timestamp jump on the existing SSRC, a new SSRC is generated for the new media stream.
  This change resolves known interoperability issues with certain SBCs (like Sonus/Ribbon) that stop forwarding media when they detect such a timestamp violation. This code uses the existing implementation from chan_sip.</p>

  There is a minor issue of a small amount of crossover distortion though as a result of <code>ast_slinear_saturated_multiply_float()</code> not rounding the float. This could result in some quiet but potentially audible distortion artifacts in lower volume parts of the signal. If you have for example a sign wave function with a max amplitude of just a few samples, all samples between -1 and 1 will be truncated to zero, resulting in the waveform no longer being a sine wave and in harmonic distortion.</p>

<h4>audiohook.c: Improve frame pairing logic to avoid MixMonitor breakage with mixed codecs</h4>
<p>Author: Michal Hajek
  Date:   2025-05-21</p>
<p>This patch adjusts the read/write synchronization logic in audiohook_read_frame_both()
  to better handle calls where participants use different codecs or sample sizes
  (e.g., alaw vs G.722). The previous hard threshold of 2 * samples caused MixMonitor
  recordings to break or stutter when frames were not aligned between both directions.</p>
<p>The new logic uses a more tolerant limit (1.5 * samples), which prevents audio tearing
  without causing excessive buffer overruns. This fix specifically addresses issues
  with MixMonitor when recording directly on a channel in a bridge using mixed codecs.</p>

<h4>app_sms.c: Fix sending and receiving SMS messages in protocol 2</h4>
<p>Author: Itzanh
  Date:   2025-04-06</p>
<p>This fixes bugs in SMS messaging to SMS-capable analog phones that prevented app_sms.c from talking to phones using SMS protocol 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix MORX message reception (from phone to Asterisk) in SMS protocol 2</li>
<li>Fix MTTX message transmission (from Asterisk to phone) in SMS protocol 2</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the bugs caused messages to have random characters and junk appended at the end up to the character limit. Another bug prevented Asterisk from sending messages from Asterisk to the phone at all. A final bug caused the transmission from Asterisk to the phone to take a long time because app_sms.c did not hang up after correctly sending the message, causing the phone to have to time out and hang up in order to complete the message transmission.</p>
<p>This was tested with a Linksys PAP2T and with a GrandStream HT814, sending and receiving messages with Telefónica DOMO Mensajes phones from Telefónica Spain. I had to play with both the network jitter buffer and the dB gain to get it to work. One of my phones required the gain to be set to +3dB for it to work, while another required it to be set to +6dB.</p>
<p>Only MORX and MTTX were tested, I did not test sending and receiving messages to a TelCo SMSC.</p>
<h4>app_queue: queue rules – Add support for QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=rN to raise penalties only for members within min/max range</h4>
<p>Author: phoneben
  Date:   2025-05-26</p>
<p>This update adds support for a new QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY format: rN</p>
<p>When QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY is set to rN (e.g., r4), only members whose current penalty
  is greater than or equal to the defined min_penalty and less than or equal to max_penalty
  will have their penalty raised to N.</p>
<p>Members with penalties outside the min/max range remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Example behaviors:</p>
<p>QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=4     → Raise all members with penalty &lt; 4 (existing behavior)
  QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=r4    → Raise only members with penalty in [min_penalty, max_penalty] to 4</p>
<p>Implementation details:</p>
<p>Adds parsing logic to detect the r prefix and sets the raise_respect_min flag</p>
<p>Modifies the raise logic to skip members outside the defined penalty range when the flag is active</p>
<p>UserNote: This change introduces QUEUE_RAISE_PENALTY=rN, allowing selective penalty raises
  only for members whose current penalty is within the [min_penalty, max_penalty] range.
  Members with lower or higher penalties are unaffected.
  This behavior is backward-compatible with existing queue rule configurations.</p>

<p>UserNote: New cache_size option for res_odbc to on a per class basis limit the

  for details.</p>
<h4>res_odbc: cache_type option for res_odbc.</h4>
<p>Author: Jaco Kroon
  Date:   2024-12-10</p>
<p>This enables setting cache_type classes to a round-robin queueing system
  rather than the historic stack mechanism.</p>
<p>This should result in lower risk of connection drops due to shorter idle
  times (the first connection to go onto the stack could in theory never
  be used again, ever, but sit there consuming resources, there could be
  multiple of these).</p>
<p>And with a queue rather than a stack, dead connections are guaranteed to
  be detected and purged eventually.</p>
<p>This should end up better balancing connection_cnt with actual load
  over time, assuming the database doesn't keep connections open
  excessively long from it's side.</p>
<p>Signed-off-by: Jaco Kroon <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#97;&#99;&#111;&#64;&#117;&#108;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#122;&#97;">&#106;&#97;&#99;&#111;&#64;&#117;&#108;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#122;&#97;</a></p>
<p>UserNote: When using res_odbc it should be noted that back-end
  connections to the underlying database can now be configured to re-use
  the cached connections in a round-robin manner rather than repeatedly
  re-using the same connection.  This helps to keep connections alive, and
  to purge dead connections from the system, thus more dynamically
  adjusting to actual load.  The downside is that one could keep too many
  connections active for a longer time resulting in resource also begin
  consumed on the database side.</p>

<h4>res_websocket_client: Create common utilities for websocket clients.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-05-02</p>
<p>Since multiple Asterisk capabilities now need to create websocket clients
  it makes sense to create a common set of utilities rather than making
  each of those capabilities implement their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>A new configuration file "websocket_client.conf" is used to store common
  client parameters in named configuration sections.</li>
<li>APIs are provided to list and retrieve ast_websocket_client objects created
  from the named configurations.</li>
<li>An API is provided that accepts an ast_websocket_client object, connects
  to the remote server with retries and returns an ast_websocket object. TLS is
  supported as is basic authentication.</li>
<li>An observer can be registered to receive notification of loaded or reloaded
  client objects.</li>
<li>An API is provided to compare an existing client object to one just
  reloaded and return the fields that were changed. The caller can then decide
  what action to take based on which fields changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also as part of thie commit, several sorcery convenience macros were created
  to make registering common object fields easier.</p>
<p>UserNote: A new module "res_websocket_client" and config file
  "websocket_client.conf" have been added to support several upcoming new
  capabilities that need common websocket client configuration.</p>

<h4>manager.c: Invalid ref-counting when purging events</h4>
<p>Author: Nathan Monfils
  Date:   2025-05-05</p>
<p>We have a use-case where we generate a <em>lot</em> of events on the AMI, and
  then when doing <code>manager show eventq</code> we would see some events which
  would linger for hours or days in there. Obviously something was leaking.
  Testing allowed us to track down this logic bug in the ref-counting on
  the event purge.</p>
<p>Reproducing the bug was not super trivial, we managed to do it in a
  production-like load testing environment with multiple AMI consumers.</p>
<p>The race condition itself:</p>
<ol>
<li>something allocates and links <code>session</code></li>
<li><code>purge_sessions</code> iterates over that <code>session</code> (takes ref)</li>
<li><code>purge_session</code> correctly de-referencess that session</li>
<li><code>purge_session</code> re-evaluates the while() loop, taking a reference</li>
<li><code>purge_session</code> exits (<code>n_max &gt; 0</code> is false)</li>
<li>whatever allocated the <code>session</code> deallocates it, but a reference is
     now lost since we exited the <code>while</code> loop before de-referencing.</li>
<li>since the destructor is never called, the session-&gt;last_ev-&gt;usecount
     is never decremented, leading to events lingering in the queue</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of this bug does not seem major. The events are small and do
  not seem, from our testing, to be causing meaningful additional CPU
  usage. Mainly we wanted to fix this issue because we are internally
  adding prometheus metrics to the eventq and those leaked events were
  causing the metrics to show garbage data.</p>

<h4>Alternate Channel Storage Backends</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph

<p>Full details: http://s.asterisk.net/dc679ec3</p>
<p>The previous proof-of-concept showed that the cpp_map_name_id alternate
  storage backed performed better than all the others so this final PR
  adds only that option.  You still need to enable it in menuselect under
  the "Alternate Channel Storage Backends" category.</p>
<p>To select which one is used at runtime, set the "channel_storage_backend"
  option in asterisk.conf to one of the values described in
  asterisk.conf.sample.  The default remains "ao2_legacy".</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: With this release, you can now select an alternate channel
  storage backend based on C++ Maps.  Using the new backend may increase
  performance and reduce the chances of deadlocks on heavily loaded systems.

<h4>pbx_ael: unregister AELSub application and CLI commands on module load failure</h4>
<p>Author: Andreas Wehrmann
  Date:   2025-04-18</p>
<p>This fixes crashes/hangs I noticed with Asterisk 20.3.0 and 20.13.0 and quickly found out,
  that the AEL module doesn't do proper cleanup when it fails to load.
  This happens for example when there are syntax errors and AEL fails to compile in which case pbx_load_module()
  returns an error but load_module() doesn't then unregister CLI cmds and the application.</p>
<h4>res_pjproject: Fix DTLS client check failing on some platforms</h4>
<p>Author: Albrecht Oster
  Date:   2025-04-10</p>
<p>Certain platforms (mainly BSD derivatives) have an additional length
  field in <code>sockaddr_in6</code> and <code>sockaddr_in</code>.
  <code>ast_sockaddr_from_pj_sockaddr()</code> does not take this field into account
  when copying over values from the <code>pj_sockaddr</code> into the <code>ast_sockaddr</code>.
  The resulting <code>ast_sockaddr</code> will have an uninitialized value for
  <code>sin6_len</code>/<code>sin_len</code> while the other <code>ast_sockaddr</code> (not converted from
  a <code>pj_sockaddr</code>) to check against in <code>ast_sockaddr_pj_sockaddr_cmp()</code>
  has the correct length value set.</p>
<p>This has the effect that <code>ast_sockaddr_cmp()</code> will always indicate
  an address mismatch, because it does a bitwise comparison, and all DTLS
  packets are dropped even if addresses and ports match.</p>
<p><code>ast_sockaddr_from_pj_sockaddr()</code> now checks whether the length fields
  are available on the current platform and sets the values accordingly.</p>

<h4>contrib: Add systemd service and timer files for malloc trim.</h4>
<p>Author: Ben Ford
  Date:   2025-04-16</p>
<p>Adds two files to the contrib/systemd/ directory that can be installed
  to periodically run "malloc trim" on Asterisk. These files do nothing
  unless they are explicitly moved to the correct location on the system.
  Users who are experiencing Asterisk memory issues can use this service
  to potentially help combat the problem. These files can also be
  configured to change the start time and interval. See systemd.timer(5)
  and systemd.time(7) for more information.</p>
<p>UserNote: Service and timer files for systemd have been added to the
  contrib/systemd/ directory. If you are experiencing memory issues,
  install these files to have "malloc trim" periodically run on the

<h4>action_redirect: remove after_bridge_goto_info</h4>
<p>Author: Peter Jannesen
  Date:   2025-03-13</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances the context/extens/prio are stored in the
  after_bridge_goto_info. This info is used when the bridge is broken by
  for hangup of the other party. In the situation that the bridge is
  broken by an AMI Redirect this info is not used but also not removed.
  With the result that when the channel is put back in a bridge and the
  bridge is broken the execution continues at the wrong
  context/extens/prio.</p>

<h4>channel: Always provide cause code in ChannelHangupRequest.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2025-04-16</p>
<p>When queueing a channel to be hung up a cause code can be
  specified in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ast_queue_hangup_with_cause
  This function takes in a cause code and queues it as part
  of the hangup request, which ultimately results in it being
  set on the channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ast_channel_hangupcause_set + ast_queue_hangup
  This combination sets the hangup cause on the channel before
  queueing the hangup instead of as part of that process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the #2 case the ChannelHangupRequest event would not contain
  the cause code. For consistency if a cause code has been set
  on the channel it will now be added to the event.</p>

<h4>asterisk.c: Add "pre-init" and "pre-module" capability to cli.conf.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-04-10</p>
<p>Commands in the "[startup_commands]" section of cli.conf have historically run
  after all core and module initialization has been completed and just before
  "Asterisk Ready" is printed on the console. This meant that if you
  wanted to debug initialization of a specific module, your only option
  was to turn on debug for everything by setting "debug" in asterisk.conf.</p>
<p>This commit introduces options to allow you to run CLI commands earlier in
  the asterisk startup process.</p>
<p>A command with a value of "pre-init" will run just after logger initialization
  but before most core, and all module, initialization.</p>
<p>A command with a value of "pre-module" will run just after all core
  initialization but before all module initialization.</p>
<p>A command with a value of "fully-booted" (or "yes" for backwards
  compatibility) will run as they always have been...after all
  initialization and just before "Asterisk Ready" is printed on the console.</p>
<p>This means you could do this...</p>
<p><code>[startup_commands]
  core set debug 3 res_pjsip.so = pre-module
  core set debug 0 res_pjsip.so = fully-booted</code></p>
<p>This would turn debugging on for res_pjsip.so to catch any module
  initialization debug messages then turn it off again after the module is
  loaded.</p>
<p>UserNote: In cli.conf, you can now define startup commands that run before
  core initialization and before module initialization.</p>

<h4>audiohook.c: Add ability to adjust volume with float</h4>
<p>Author: mkmer
  Date:   2025-03-18</p>
<p>Add the capability to audiohook for float type volume adjustments.  This allows for adjustments to volume smaller than 6dB.  With INT adjustments, the first step is 2 which converts to ~6dB (or 1/2 volume / double volume depending on adjustment sign). 3dB is a typical adjustment level which can now be accommodated with an adjustment value of 1.41.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by the following:
    Convert internal variables to type float.
    Always use ast_frame_adjust_volume_float() for adjustments.
    Cast int to float in original functions ast_audiohook_volume_set(), and ast_volume_adjust().
    Cast float to int in ast_audiohook_volume_get()
    Add functions ast_audiohook_volume_get_float, ast_audiohook_volume_set_float, and ast_audiohook_volume_adjust_float.</p>
<p>This update maintains 100% backward compatibility.</p>

<h4>chan_pjsip: set correct Endpoint Device State on multiple channels</h4>
<p>Author: Alexei Gradinari
  Date:   2025-03-25</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When one channel is placed on hold, the device state is set to ONHOLD
  without checking other channels states.
  In case of AST_CONTROL_HOLD set the device state as AST_DEVICE_UNKNOWN
  to calculate aggregate device state of all active channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current implementation incorrectly classifies channels in use.
  The only channels that has the states: UP, RING and BUSY are considered as "in use".
  A channel should be considered "in use" if its state is anything other than
  DOWN or RESERVED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, if the number of channels "in use" is greater than device_state_busy_at,
  the system does not set the state to BUSY. Instead, it incorrectly assigns an aggregate
  device state.
  The endpoint device state should be BUSY if the number of channels "in use" is greater
  than or equal to device_state_busy_at.</p>
</li>

<h4>documentation: Update Gosub, Goto, and add new documentationtype.</h4>
<p>Author: Ben Ford
  Date:   2025-03-14</p>
<p>Gosub and Goto were not displaying their syntax correctly on the docs
  site. This change adds a new way to specify an optional context, an
  optional extension, and a required priority that the xml stylesheet can
  parse without having to know which optional parameters come in which
  order. In Asterisk, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>parameter name="context" documentationtype="dialplan_context"
parameter name="extension" documentationtype="dialplan_extension"
parameter name="priority" documentationtype="dialplan_priority" required="true"
</code></pre>
<p>The stylesheet will ignore the context and extension parameters, but for
  priority, it will automatically inject the following:</p>
<pre><code>[[context,]extension,]priority
</code></pre>
<p>This is the correct oder for applications such as Gosub and Goto.</p>

<h4>swagger_model.py: Fix invalid escape sequence in get_list_parameter_type().</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-03-04</p>
<p>Recent python versions complain when backslashes in strings create invalid
  escape sequences.  This causes issues for strings used as regex patterns like
  <code>'^List\[(.*)\]$'</code> where you want the regex parser to treat <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>
  as literals.  Double-backslashing is one way to fix it but simply converting
  the string to a raw string <code>re.match(r'^List\[(.*)\]$', text)</code> is easier
  and less error prone.</p>

<h4>bridging: Fix multiple bridging issues causing SEGVs and FRACKs.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-01-22</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridging core allowed multiple bridges to be created with the same
    unique bridgeId at the same time.  Only the last bridge created with the
    duplicate name was actually saved to the core bridges container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridging core was creating a stasis topic for the bridge and saving it
    in the bridge-&gt;topic field but not increasing its reference count.  In the
    case where two bridges were created with the same uniqueid (which is also
    the topic name), the second bridge would get the <em>existing</em> topic the first
    bridge created.  When the first bridge was destroyed, it would take the
    topic with it so when the second bridge attempted to publish a message to
    it it either FRACKed or SEGVd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge destructor, which also destroys the bridge topic, is run from the
    bridge manager thread not the caller's thread.  This makes it possible for
    an ARI developer to create a new one with the same uniqueid believing the
    old one was destroyed when, in fact, the old one's destructor hadn't
    completed. This could cause the new bridge to get the old one's topic just
    before the topic was destroyed.  When the new bridge attempted to publish
    a message on that topic, asterisk could either FRACK or SEGV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ARI bridges resource also allowed multiple bridges to be created with
    the same uniqueid but it kept the duplicate bridges in its app_bridges
    container.  This created a situation where if you added two bridges with
    the same "bridge1" uniqueid, all operations on "bridge1" were performed on
    the first bridge created and the second was basically orphaned.  If you
    attempted to delete what you thought was the second bridge, you actually
    deleted the first one created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new API <code>ast_bridge_topic_exists(uniqueid)</code> was created to determine if
    a topic already exists for a bridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bridge_base_init()</code> in bridge.c and <code>ast_ari_bridges_create()</code> in
    resource_bridges.c now call <code>ast_bridge_topic_exists(uniqueid)</code> to check
    if a bridge with the requested uniqueid already exists and will fail if it
    does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bridge_register()</code> in bridges.c now checks the core bridges container to
    make sure a bridge doesn't already exist with the requested uniqueid.
    Although most callers of <code>bridge_register()</code> will have already called
    <code>bridge_base_init()</code>, which will now fail on duplicate bridges, there
    is no guarantee of this so we must check again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core bridges container allocation was changed to reject duplicate
    uniqueids instead of silently replacing an existing one. This is a "belt
    and suspenders" check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A global mutex was added to bridge.c to prevent concurrent calls to
    <code>bridge_base_init()</code> and <code>bridge_register()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though you can no longer create multiple bridges with the same uniqueid
    at the same time, it's still possible that the bridge topic might be
    destroyed while a second bridge with the same uniqueid was trying to use
    it. To address this, the bridging core now increments the reference count
    on bridge-&gt;topic when a bridge is created and decrements it when the
    bridge is destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bridge_create_common()</code> in res_stasis.c now checks the stasis app_bridges
    container to make sure a bridge with the requested uniqueid doesn't already
    exist.  This may seem like overkill but there are so many entrypoints to
    bridge creation that we need to be safe and catch issues as soon in the
    process as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stasis app_bridges container allocation was changed to reject duplicate
    uniqueids instead of adding them. This is a "belt and suspenders" check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>bridge show all</code> CLI command now shows the bridge name as well as the
    bridge id.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Response code 409 "Conflict" was added as a possible response from the ARI
    bridge create resources to signal that a bridge with the requested uniqueid
    already exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional debugging was added to multiple bridging and stasis files.</p>

<h4>bridge_channel: don't set cause code on channel during bridge delete if already set</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2025-02-18</p>
<p>Due to a potential race condition via ARI when hanging up a channel hangup with cause
  while also deleting a bridge containing that channel, the bridge delete can over-write
  the hangup cause code resulting in Normal Call Clearing instead of the set value.</p>
<p>With this change, bridge deletion will only set the hangup code if it hasn't been
  previously set.</p>

<h4>res_stir_shaken: Allow missing or anonymous CID to continue to the dialplan.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-02-05</p>
<p>The verification check for missing or anonymous callerid was happening before
  the endpoint's profile was retrieved which meant that the failure_action
  parameter wasn't available.  Therefore, if verification was enabled and there
  was no callerid or it was "anonymous", the call was immediately terminated
  instead of giving the dialplan the ability to decide what to do with the call.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The callerid check now happens after the verification context is created and
    the endpoint's stir_shaken_profile is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check now processes the callerid failure just as it does for other
    verification failures and respects the failure_action parameter.  If set
    to "continue" or "continue_return_reason", <code>STIR_SHAKEN(0,verify_result)</code>
    in the dialplan will return "invalid_or_no_callerid".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the endpoint's failure_action is "reject_request", the call will be
    rejected with <code>433 "Anonymity Disallowed"</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the endpoint's failure_action is "continue_return_reason", the call will
    continue but a <code>Reason: STIR; cause=433; text="Anonymity Disallowed"</code>
    header will be added to the next provisional or final response.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Between ast_ari_channels_external_media(), external_media_rtp_udp(),
  and external_media_audiosocket_tcp(), the <code>variables</code> structure being passed
  around wasn't being cleaned up properly when there was a failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In ast_ari_channels_external_media(), the <code>variables</code> structure is now

</li>
<li>
<p>The ast_variables_destroy() call was removed from

<h4>ari/pjsip: Make it possible to control transfers through ARI</h4>
<p>Author: Holger Hans Peter Freyther

<p>Introduce a ChannelTransfer event and the ability to notify progress to

<h4>res_pjsip_authenticator_digest: Make correct error messages appear again.</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-01-28</p>
<p>When an incoming request can't be matched to an endpoint, the "artificial"
  auth object is used to create a challenge to return in a 401 response and we
  emit a "No matching endpoint found" log message. If the client then responds
  with an Authorization header but the request still can't be matched to an
  endpoint, the verification will fail and, as before, we'll create a challenge
  to return in a 401 response and we emit a "No matching endpoint found" log
  message.  HOWEVER, because there WAS an Authorization header and it failed
  verification, we should have also been emitting a "Failed to authenticate"
  log message but weren't because there was a check that short-circuited that
  it if the artificial auth was used.  Since many admins use the "Failed to
  authenticate" message with log parsers like fail2ban, those attempts were not
  being recognized as suspicious.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>digest_check_auth() now always emits the "Failed to authenticate" log
    message if verification of an Authorization header failed even if the
    artificial auth was used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The verification logic was refactored to be clearer about the handling
    of the return codes from verify().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comments were added clarify what return codes digest_check_auth() should
    return to the distributor and the implications of changing them.</p>
</li>

<li>Removed the allocations in ast_sip_auth_digest_algorithms_vector_init().</li>
<li>Added a note to the doc for ast_sip_auth_digest_algorithms_vector_init()

    DOCUMENTATION block contained a XML fragment that consisted only of
    a managerEventInstance element that wasn't wrapped in a managerEvent

<h4>docs: Add version information to configObject and configOption XML elements</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-01-16</p>
<p>Most of the configObjects and configOptions that are implemented with
  ACO or Sorcery now have <code>&lt;since&gt;/&lt;version&gt;</code> elements added.  There are
  probably some that the script I used didn't catch.  The version tags were
  determined by the following...
   * Do a git blame on the API call that created the object or option.
   * From the commit hash, grab the summary line.
   * Do a <code>git log --grep &lt;summary&gt;</code> to find the cherry-pick commits in all
     branches that match.
   * Do a <code>git patch-id</code> to ensure the commits are all related and didn't get
     a false match on the summary.
   * Do a <code>git tag --contains &lt;commit&gt;</code> to find the tags that contain each
     commit.
   * Weed out all tags not <major>.<minor>.0.
   * Sort and discard any <major>.0.0 and following tags where the commit
     appeared in an earlier branch.
   * The result is a single tag for each branch where the API was last touched.</p>
<p>configObjects and configOptions elements implemented with the base
  ast_config APIs were just not possible to find due to the non-deterministic
  way they are accessed.</p>
<p>Also note that if the API call was on modified after it was added, the
  version will be the one it was last modified in.</p>
<p>Final note:  The configObject and configOption elements were introduced in
  12.0.0 so options created before then may not have any XML documentation.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_authenticator_digest: Fix issue with missing auth and DONT_OPTIMIZE</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-01-17</p>
<p>The return code fom digest_check_auth wasn't explicitly being initialized.
  The return code also wasn't explicitly set to CHALLENGE when challenges
  were sent.  When optimization was turned off (DONT_OPTIMIZE), the compiler
  was setting it to "0"(CHALLENGE) which worked fine.  However, with
  optimization turned on, it was setting it to "1" (SUCCESS) so if there was
  no incoming Authorization header, the function was returning SUCCESS to the
  distributor allowing the request to incorrectly succeed.</p>
<p>The return code is now initialized correctly and is now explicitly set
  to CHALLENGE when we send challenges.</p>

  to not require a passphrase. Add an option (-e) that disables
  encryption of the CA private key so no passphrase is required.</p>

<h4>chan_iax2: Avoid unnecessarily backlogging non-voice frames.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2025-01-09</p>
<p>Currently, when receiving an unauthenticated call, we keep track
  of the negotiated format in the chosenformat, which allows us
  to later create the channel using the right format. However,
  this was not done for authenticated calls. This meant that in
  certain circumstances, if we had not yet received a voice frame
  from the peer, only certain other types of frames (e.g. text),
  there were no variables containing the appropriate frame.
  This led to problems in the jitterbuffer callback where we
  unnecessarily bailed out of retrieving a frame from the jitterbuffer.
  This was logic intentionally added in commit 73103bdcd5b342ce5dfa32039333ffadad551151
  in response to an earlier regression, and while this prevents
  crashes, it also backlogs legitimate frames unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The abort logic was initially added because at this point in the
  code, we did not have the negotiated format available to us.
  However, it should always be available to us as a last resort
  in chosenformat, so we now pull it from there if needed. This
  allows us to process frames the jitterbuffer even if voicefmt
  and peerfmt aren't set and still avoid the crash. The failsafe
  logic is retained, but now it shouldn't be triggered anymore.</p>

    manager show command &lt;command&gt;
    manager show event &lt;event&gt;
    agi show commands topic &lt;topic&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactored the commands above to output their sections in the same order:
    Synopsis, Since, Description, Syntax, Arguments, SeeAlso</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactored the commands above so they all use the same pattern for writing
    the output to the CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed several memory leaks caused by failure to free temporary output
    buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a "since" array to the mustache template for the top-level resources
    (Channel, Endpoint, etc.) and to the paths/methods underneath them. These

<h4>Add SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 as authentication digest algorithms</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-10-17</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Refactored pjproject code to support the new algorithms and
  added a patch file to third-party/pjproject/patches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new parameters to the pjsip auth object:</p>
<ul>
<li>password_digest = <algorithm>:<digest></li>
<li>supported_algorithms_uac = List of algorithms to support
  when acting as a UAC.</li>
<li>supported_algorithms_uas = List of algorithms to support
  when acting as a UAS.
See the auth object in pjsip.conf.sample for detailed info.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated both res_pjsip_authenticator_digest.c (for UAS) and
  res_pjsip_outbound_authentocator_digest.c (UAC) to suport the
  new algorithms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new algorithms are only available with the bundled version
  of pjproject, or an external version &gt; 2.14.1.  OpenSSL version
  1.1.1 or greater is required to support SHA-512-256.</p>
<p>Resolves: #948</p>
<p>UserNote: The SHA-256 and SHA-512-256 algorithms are now available
  for authentication as both a UAS and a UAC.</p>
<h4>config.c: retain leading whitespace before comments</h4>

<h4>Add C++ Standard detection to configure and fix a new C++20 compile issue</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2025-01-03</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The autoconf-archive package contains macros useful for detecting C++
    standard and testing other C++ capabilities but that package was never
    included in the install_prereq script so many existing build environments
    won't have it.  Even if it is installed, older versions won't newer C++
    standards and will actually cause an error if you try to test for that
    version. To make it available for those environments, the
    ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4 macro has copied from the latest release of
    autoconf-archive into the autoconf directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A convenience wrapper(ast_cxx_check_std) around ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx was
    also added so checking the standard version and setting the
    asterisk-specific PBX_ variables becomes a one-liner:
    <code>AST_CXX_CHECK_STD([std], [force_latest_std])</code>.
    Calling that with a version of <code>17</code> for instance, will set PBX_CXX17
    to 0 or 1 depending on whether the current c++ compiler supports stdc++17.
    HAVE_CXX17 will also be 'defined" or not depending on the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++ compilers hardly ever default to the latest standard they support.  g++
    version 14 for instance supports up to C++23 but only uses C++17 by default.
    If you want to use C++23, you have to add <code>-std=gnu++=23</code> to the g++
    command line.  If you set the second argument of AST_CXX_CHECK_STD to "yes",
    the macro will automatically keep the highest <code>-std=gnu++</code> value that
    worked and pass that to the Makefiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The autoconf-archive package was added to install_prereq for future use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated configure.ac to use AST_CXX_CHECK_STD() to check for C++
    versions 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated configure.ac to accept the <code>--enable-latest-cxx-std</code> option which
    will set the second option to AST_CXX_CHECK_STD() to "yes".  The default
    is "no".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ast_copy_string() in strings.h declares the 'sz' variable as volatile and
    does an <code>sz--</code> on it later.  C++20 no longer allows the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
    increment and decrement operators to be used on variables declared as
    volatile however so that was changed to <code>sz -= 1</code>.</p>
</li>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Fix wrong channel state when RINGING recieved.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-12-16</p>
<p>Previously, when AST_CONTROL_RINGING was received by
  a DAHDI device, it would set its channel state to
  AST_STATE_RINGING. However, an analysis of the codebase
  and other channel drivers reveals RINGING corresponds to
  physical power ringing, whereas AST_STATE_RING should be
  used for audible ringback on the channel. This also ensures
  the correct device state is returned by the channel state
  to device state conversion.</p>
<p>Since there seems to be confusion in various places regarding
  AST_STATE_RING vs. AST_STATE_RINGING, some documentation has
  been added or corrected to clarify the actual purposes of these
  two channel states, and the associated device state mapping.</p>
<p>An edge case that prompted this fix, but isn't explicitly
  addressed here, is that of an incoming call to an FXO port.
  The channel state will be "Ring", which maps to a device state
  of "In Use", not "Ringing" as would be more intuitive. However,
  this is semantic, since technically, Asterisk is treating this
  the same as any other incoming call, and so "Ring" is the
  semantic state (put another way, Asterisk isn't ringing anything,
  like in the cases where channels are in the "Ringing" state).</p>
<p>Since FXO ports don't currently support Call Waiting, a suitable
  workaround for the above would be to ignore the device state and
  instead check the channel state (e.g. IMPORT(DAHDI/1-1,CHANNEL(state)))
  since it will be Ring if the FXO port is idle (but a call is ringing
  on it) and Up if the FXO port is actually in use. (In both cases,
  the device state would misleadingly be "In Use".)</p>

<h4>Header fixes for compiling C++ source files</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-12-31</p>
<p>A few tweaks needed to be done to some existing header files to allow them to
  be compiled when included from C++ source files.</p>
<p>logger.h had declarations for ast_register_verbose() and
  ast_unregister_verbose() which caused C++ issues but those functions were
  actually removed from logger.c many years ago so the declarations were just
  removed from logger.h.</p>
<h4>Add ability to pass arguments to unit tests from the CLI</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-12-27</p>
<p>Unit tests can now be passed custom arguments from the command
  line.  For example, the following command would run the "mytest" test
  in the "/main/mycat" category with the option "myoption=54"</p>
<p><code>CLI&gt; test execute category /main/mycat name mytest options myoption=54</code></p>
<p>You can also pass options to an entire category...</p>
<p><code>CLI&gt; test execute category /main/mycat options myoption=54</code></p>
<p>Basically, everything after the "options" keyword is passed verbatim to
  the test which must decide what to do with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new API ast_test_get_cli_args() was created to give the tests access to
  the cli_args-&gt;argc and cli_args-&gt;argv elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although not needed for the option processing, a new macro
  ast_test_validate_cleanup_custom() was added to test.h that allows you
  to specify a custom error message instead of just "Condition failed".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The test_skel.c was updated to demonstrate parsing options and the use
  of the ast_test_validate_cleanup_custom() macro.</p>
</li>

<h4>res_pjsip: Add new AOR option "qualify_2xx_only"</h4>
<p>Author: Kent
  Date:   2024-12-03</p>
<p>Added a new option "qualify_2xx_only" to the res_pjsip AOR qualify
  feature to mark a contact as available only if an OPTIONS request
  returns a 2XX response. If the option is not specified or is false,
  any response to the OPTIONS request marks the contact as available.</p>
<p>UserNote: The pjsip.conf AOR section now has a "qualify_2xx_only"
  option that can be set so that only 2XX responses to OPTIONS requests
  used to qualify a contact will mark the contact as available.</p>
<h4>res_odbc: release threads from potential starvation.</h4>
<p>Author: Jaco Kroon
  Date:   2024-12-10</p>
<p>Whenever a slot is freed up due to a failed connection, wake up a waiter
  before failing.</p>
<p>In the case of a dead connection there could be waiters, for example,
  let's say two threads tries to acquire objects at the same time, with
  one in the cached connections, one will acquire the dead connection, and
  the other will enter into the wait state.  The thread with the dead
  connection will clear up the dead connection, and then attempt a
  re-acquire (at this point there cannot be cached connections else the
  other thread would have received that and tried to clean up), as such,
  at this point we're guaranteed that either there are no waiting threads,
  or that the maxconnections - connection_cnt threads will attempt to
  re-acquire connections, and then either succeed, using those
  connections, or failing, and then signalling to release more waiters.</p>
<p>Also fix the pointer log for ODBC handle %p dead which would always
  reflect NULL.</p>

<h4>res_stir_shaken: Allow sending Identity headers for unknown TNs</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-11-08</p>
<p>Added a new option "unknown_tn_attest_level" to allow Identity
  headers to be sent when a callerid TN isn't explicitly configured
  in stir_shaken.conf.  Since there's no TN object, a private_key_file
  and public_cert_url must be configured in the attestation or profile
  objects.</p>
<p>Since "unknown_tn_attest_level" uses the same enum as attest_level,
  some of the sorcery macros had to be refactored to allow sharing
  the enum and to/from string conversion functions.</p>
<p>Also fixed a memory leak in crypto_utils:pem_file_cb().</p>
<p>Resolves: #921</p>
<p>UserNote: You can now set the "unknown_tn_attest_level" option
  in the attestation and/or profile objects in stir_shaken.conf to
  enable sending Identity headers for callerid TNs not explicitly
  configured.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip: Add new endpoint option "suppress_moh_on_sendonly"</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-11-05</p>
<p>Normally, when one party in a call sends Asterisk an SDP with
  a "sendonly" or "inactive" attribute it means "hold" and causes
  Asterisk to start playing MOH back to the other party. This can be
  problematic if it happens at certain times, such as in a 183
  Progress message, because the MOH will replace any early media you
  may be playing to the calling party. If you set this option
  to "yes" on an endpoint and the endpoint receives an SDP
  with "sendonly" or "inactive", Asterisk will NOT play MOH back to
  the other party.</p>
<p>Resolves: #979</p>
<p>UserNote: The new "suppress_moh_on_sendonly" endpoint option
  can be used to prevent playing MOH back to a caller if the remote
  end sends "sendonly" or "inactive" (hold) to Asterisk in an SDP.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip: Move tenantid to end of ast_sip_endpoint</h4>

  Date:   2024-11-06</p>
<p>The tenantid field was originally added to the ast_sip_endpoint
  structure at the end of the AST_DECLARE_STRING_FIELDS block.  This
  caused everything after it in the structure to move down in memory
  and break ABI compatibility.  It's now at the end of the structure
  as an AST_STRING_FIELD_EXTENDED.  Given the number of string fields
  in the structure now, the initial string field allocation was
  also increased from 64 to 128 bytes.</p>

<h4>pjsip_transport_events: handle multiple addresses for a domain</h4>
<p>Author: Thomas Guebels
  Date:   2024-10-29</p>
<p>The key used for transport monitors was the remote host name for the
  transport and not the remote address resolved for this domain.</p>
<p>This was problematic for domains returning multiple addresses as several
  transport monitors were created with the same key.</p>
<p>Whenever a subsystem wanted to register a callback it would always end
  up attached to the first transport monitor with a matching key.</p>
<p>The key used for transport monitors is now the remote address and port
  the transport actually connected to.</p>

<h4>func_evalexten: Add EVAL_SUB function.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert

<p>This adds an EVAL_SUB function, which is similar to the existing
  EVAL_EXTEN function but significantly more powerful, as it allows
  executing arbitrary dialplan and capturing its return value as
  the function's output. While EVAL_EXTEN should be preferred if it
  is possible to use it, EVAL_SUB can be used in a wider variety
  of cases and allows arbitrary computation to be performed in
  a dialplan function call, leveraging the dialplan.</p>

<h4>app_mixmonitor: Add 'D' option for dual-channel audio.</h4>
<p>Author: Ben Ford
  Date:   2024-10-28</p>
<p>Adds the 'D' option to app_mixmonitor that interleaves the input and
  output frames of the channel being recorded in the monitor output frame.
  This allows for two streams in the recording: the transmitted audio and
  the received audio. The 't' and 'r' options are compatible with this.</p>
<p>Fixes: #945</p>
<p>UserNote: The MixMonitor application now has a new 'D' option which
  interleaves the recorded audio in the output frames. This allows for
  stereo recording output with one channel being the transmitted audio and
  the other being the received audio. The 't' and 't' options are
  compatible with this.</p>
<h4>pjsip_transport_events: Avoid monitor destruction</h4>
<p>Author: Thomas Guebels
  Date:   2024-10-28</p>
<p>When a transport is disconnected, several events can arrive following
  each other. The first event will be PJSIP_TP_STATE_DISCONNECT and it
  will trigger the destruction of the transport monitor object. The lookup

<p>Subsequent events can arrive later like PJSIP_TP_STATE_DESTROY and will

<h4>pjproject_bundled:  Tweaks to support out-of-tree development</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-10-17</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pjproject is now configured with --disable-libsrtp so it will
    build correctly when doing "out-of-tree" development.  Asterisk
    doesn't use pjproject for handling media so pjproject doesn't
    need libsrtp itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pjsua app (which we used to use for the testsuite) no longer
    builds in pjproject's master branch so we just skip it.  The
    testsuite no longer needs it anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See third-party/pjproject/README-hacking.md for more info on building
  pjproject "out-of-tree".</p>
<h4>Revert "res_rtp_asterisk: Count a roll-over of the sequence number even on lost packets."</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2024-10-07</p>
<p>This reverts commit cb5e3445be6c55517c8d05aca601b648341f8ae9.</p>
<p>The original change from 16 to 15 bit sequence numbers was predicated
  on the following from the now-defunct libSRTP FAQ on sourceforge.net:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Q6. The use of implicit synchronization via ROC seems
dangerous. Can senders and receivers lose ROC synchronization?</em></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It is possible to lose ROC synchronization between sender and
receiver(s), though it is not likely in practice, and practical
steps can be taken to avoid it. A burst loss of 2^16 packets or more
will always break synchronization. For example, a conversational
voice codec that sends 50 packets per second will have its ROC
increment about every 22 minutes. A network with a burst of packet
loss that long has problems other than ROC synchronization.</p>
<p>There is a higher sensitivity to loss at the very outset of an SRTP
stream. If the sender's initial sequence number is close to the
maximum value of 2^16-1, and all packets are lost from the initial
packet until the sequence number cycles back to zero, the sender
will increment its ROC, but the receiver will not. The receiver
cannot determine that the initial packets were lost and that
sequence-number rollover has occurred. In this case, the receiver's
ROC would be zero whereas the sender's ROC would be one, while their
sequence numbers would be so close that the ROC-guessing algorithm
could not detect this fact.</p>
<p>There is a simple solution to this problem: the SRTP sender should
randomly select an initial sequence number that is always less than
2^15. This ensures correct SRTP operation so long as fewer than 2^15
initial packets are lost in succession, which is within the maximum
tolerance of SRTP packet-index determination (see Appendix A and
page 14, first paragraph of RFC 3711). An SRTP receiver should
carefully implement the index-guessing algorithm. A naive
implementation can unintentionally guess the value of
0xffffffffffffLL whenever the SEQ in the packet is greater than 2^15
and the locally stored SEQ and ROC are zero. (This can happen when
the implementation fails to treat those zero values as a special
case.)</p>
<p>When ROC synchronization is lost, the receiver will not be able to
properly process the packets. If anti-replay protection is turned
on, then the desynchronization will appear as a burst of replay
check failures. Otherwise, if authentication is being checked, then
it will appear as a burst of authentication failures. Otherwise, if
encryption is being used, the desynchronization may not be detected
by the SRTP layer, and the packets may be improperly decrypted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, modern libSRTP (as of 1.0.1[1]) now mentions the following in
  their README.md[2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sequence number in the rtp packet is used as the low 16 bits of
the sender's local packet index. Note that RTP will start its
sequence number in a random place, and the SRTP layer just jumps
forward to that number at its first invocation. An earlier version
of this library used initial sequence numbers that are less than
32,768; this trick is no longer required as the
rdbx_estimate_index(...) function has been made smarter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So truncating our initial sequence number to 15 bit is no longer
  necessary.</p>

<h4>core_unreal.c: Fix memory leak in ast_unreal_new_channels()</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-10-15</p>
<p>When the channel tech is multistream capable, the reference to
  chan_topology was passed to the new channel.  When the channel tech
  isn't multistream capable, the reference to chan_topology was never
  released.  "Local" channels are multistream capable so it didn't
  affect them but the confbridge "CBAnn" and the bridge_media
  "Recorder" channels are not so they caused a leak every time one
  of them was created.</p>
<p>Also added tracing to ast_stream_topology_alloc() and
  stream_topology_destroy() to assist with debugging.</p>

<h4>dnsmgr.c: dnsmgr_refresh() incorrectly flags change with DNS round-robin</h4>
<p>Author: Allan Nathanson
  Date:   2024-09-29</p>
<p>The dnsmgr_refresh() function checks to see if the IP address associated
  with a name/service has changed. The gotcha is that the ast_get_ip_or_srv()
  function only returns the first IP address returned by the DNS query. If
  there are multiple IPs associated with the name and the returned order is
  not consistent (e.g. with DNS round-robin) then the other IP addresses are
  not included in the comparison and the entry is flagged as changed even
  though the IP is still valid.</p>
<p>Updated the code to check all IP addresses and flag a change only if the
  original IP is no longer valid.</p>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Never send MWI while off-hook.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-10-01</p>
<p>In some circumstances, it is possible for the do_monitor thread to
  erroneously think that a line is on-hook and send an MWI FSK spill
  to it when the line is really off-hook and no MWI should be sent.
  Commit 0a8b3d34673277b70be6b0e8ac50191b1f3c72c6 previously fixed this
  issue in a more readily encountered scenario, but it has still been
  possible for MWI to be sent when it shouldn't be. To robustly fix
  this issue, query DAHDI for the hook status to ensure we don't send
  MWI on a line that is actually still off hook.</p>

<h4>res_agi.c: Ensure SIGCHLD handler functions are properly balanced.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2024-09-30</p>
<p>Calls to <code>ast_replace_sigchld()</code> and <code>ast_unreplace_sigchld()</code> must be
  balanced to ensure that we can capture the exit status of child
  processes when we need to. This extends to functions that call
  <code>ast_replace_sigchld()</code> and <code>ast_unreplace_sigchld()</code> such as
  <code>ast_safe_fork()</code> and <code>ast_safe_fork_cleanup()</code>.</p>
<p>The primary change here is ensuring that we do not call
  <code>ast_safe_fork_cleanup()</code> in <code>res_agi.c</code> if we have not previously
  called <code>ast_safe_fork()</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally we reinforce some of the documentation and add an
  assertion to, ideally, catch this sooner were this to happen again.</p>

<h4>res_rtp_asterisk: Fix dtls timer issues causing FRACKs and SEGVs</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-09-16</p>
<p>In dtls_srtp_handle_timeout(), when DTLSv1_get_timeout() returned
  success but with a timeout of 0, we were stopping the timer and
  decrementing the refcount on instance but not resetting the
  timeout_timer to -1.  When dtls_srtp_stop_timeout_timer()
  was later called, it was atempting to stop a stale timer and could
  decrement the refcount on instance again which would then cause
  the instance destructor to run early.  This would result in either
  a FRACK or a SEGV when ast_rtp_stop(0 was called.</p>
<p>According to the OpenSSL docs, we shouldn't have been stopping the
  timer when DTLSv1_get_timeout() returned success and the new timeout
  was 0 anyway.  We should have been calling DTLSv1_handle_timeout()
  again immediately so we now reschedule the timer callback for
  1ms (almost immediately).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of scheduling the timer callback at a fixed
  interval returned by the initial call to DTLSv1_get_timeout()
  (usually 999 ms), we now reschedule the next callback based on
  the last call to DTLSv1_get_timeout().</p>

<h4>db.c: Remove limit on family/key length</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-09-11</p>
<p>Consumers like media_cache have been running into issues with
  the previous astdb "/family/key" limit of 253 bytes when needing
  to store things like long URIs.  An Amazon S3 URI is a good example
  of this.  Now, instead of using a static 256 byte buffer for
  "/family/key", we use ast_asprintf() to dynamically create it.</p>
<p>Both test_db.c and test_media_cache.c were also updated to use
  keys/URIs over the old 253 character limit.</p>
<p>Resolves: #881</p>
<p>UserNote: The <code>ast_db_*()</code> APIs have had the 253 byte limit on
  "/family/key" removed and will now accept families and keys with a
  total length of up to SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH (currently 1e9!).  This
  affects the <code>DB*</code> dialplan applications, dialplan functions,
  manager actions and <code>databse</code> CLI commands.  Since the
  media_cache also uses the <code>ast_db_*()</code> APIs, you can now store
  resources with URIs longer than 253 bytes.</p>
<h4>stir_shaken: Fix propagation of attest_level and a few other values</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-09-24</p>
<p>attest_level, send_mky and check_tn_cert_public_url weren't
  propagating correctly from the attestation object to the profile
  and tn.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case of attest_level, the enum needed to be changed
  so the "0" value (the default) was "NOT_SET" instead of "A".  This
  now allows the merging of the attestation object, profile and tn
  to detect when a value isn't set and use the higher level value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For send_mky and check_tn_cert_public_url, the tn default was
  forced to "NO" which always overrode the profile and attestation
  objects.  Their defaults are now "NOT_SET" so the propagation
  happens correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just to remove some redundant code in tn_config.c, a bunch of calls to
  generate_sorcery_enum_from_str() and generate_sorcery_enum_to_str() were

<p>The ub_result pointer passed to unbound_resolver_callback by

<p>Author: Cade Parker
  Date:   2024-08-07</p>
<p>On modern Bluetooth devices or lower-powered asterisk servers, decreasing the channel frame size significantly improves latency and delay on outbound calls with only a mild sacrifice to the quality of the call (the frame size before was massive overkill to begin with)</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_notify: add dialplan application</h4>

<p>Add dialplan application PJSIPNOTIFY to send either pre-configured
  NOTIFY messages from pjsip_notify.conf or with headers defined in
  dialplan.</p>
<p>Also adds the ability to send pre-configured NOTIFY commands to a
  channel via the CLI.</p>
<p>Resolves: #799</p>
<p>UserNote: A new dialplan application PJSIPNotify is now available
  which can send SIP NOTIFY requests from the dialplan.</p>
<p>The pjsip send notify CLI command has also been enhanced to allow
  sending NOTIFY messages to a specific channel. Syntax:</p>
<p>pjsip send notify <option> channel <channel></p>
<h4>manager.c: Fix FRACK when doing CoreShowChannelMap in DEVMODE</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-08-08</p>
<p>If you run an AMI CoreShowChannelMap on a channel that isn't in a
  bridge and you're in DEVMODE, you can get a FRACK because the
  bridge id is empty.  We now simply return an empty list for that
  request.</p>
<h4>channel: Add multi-tenant identifier.</h4>
<p>Author: Ben Ford
  Date:   2024-05-21</p>
<p>This patch introduces a new identifier for channels: tenantid. It's
  a stringfield on the channel that can be used for general purposes. It
  will be inherited by other channels the same way that linkedid is.</p>
<p>You can set tenantid in a few ways. The first is to set it in the
  dialplan with the Set and CHANNEL functions:</p>
<p>exten =&gt; example,1,Set(CHANNEL(tenantid)=My tenant ID)</p>
<p>It can also be accessed via CHANNEL:</p>
<p>exten =&gt; example,2,NoOp(CHANNEL(tenantid))</p>
<p>Another method is to use the new tenantid option for pjsip endpoints in
  pjsip.conf:</p>
<p>[my_endpoint]
  type=endpoint
  tenantid=My tenant ID</p>
<p>This is considered the best approach since you will be able to see the
  tenant ID as early as the Newchannel event.</p>
<p>It can also be set using set_var in pjsip.conf on the endpoint like
  setting other channel variable:</p>
<p>set_var=CHANNEL(tenantid)=My tenant ID</p>
<p>Note that set_var will not show tenant ID on the Newchannel event,
  however.</p>
<p>Tenant ID has also been added to CDR. It's read-only and can be accessed
  via CDR(tenantid). You can also get the tenant ID of the last channel
  communicated with via CDR(peertenantid).</p>
<p>Tenant ID will also show up in CEL records if it has been set, and the
  version number has been bumped accordingly.</p>
<p>Fixes: #740</p>
<p>UserNote: tenantid has been added to channels. It can be read in
  dialplan via CHANNEL(tenantid), and it can be set using
  Set(CHANNEL(tenantid)=My tenant ID). In pjsip.conf, it is recommended to
  use the new tenantid option for pjsip endpoints (e.g., tenantid=My
  tenant ID) so that it will show up in Newchannel events. You can set it
  like any other channel variable using set_var in pjsip.conf as well, but
  note that this will NOT show up in Newchannel events. Tenant ID is also
  available in CDR and can be accessed with CDR(tenantid). The peer tenant
  ID can also be accessed with CDR(peertenantid). CEL includes tenant ID
  as well if it has been set.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: A new versioned struct (ast_channel_initializers) has been
  added that gets passed to __ast_channel_alloc_ap. The new function
  ast_channel_alloc_with_initializers should be used when creating
  channels that require the use of this struct. Currently the only value
  in the struct is for tenantid, but now more fields can be added to the
  struct as necessary rather than the __ast_channel_alloc_ap function. A
  new option (tenantid) has been added to endpoints in pjsip.conf as well.
  CEL has had its version bumped to include tenant ID.</p>

<h4>stir_shaken: CRL fixes and a new CLI command</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-19</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in crypto_show_cli_store that was causing asterisk
  to crash if there were certificate revocation lists in the
  verification certificate store.  We're also now prefixing
  certificates with "Cert:" and CRLs with "CRL:" to distinguish them
  in the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added 'untrusted_cert_file' and 'untrusted_cert_path' options
  to both verification and profile objects.  If you have CRLs that
  are signed by a different CA than the incoming X5U certificate
  (indirect CRL), you'll need to provide the certificate of the
  CRL signer here.  Thse will show up as 'Untrusted" when showing
  the verification or profile objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed loading of crl_path.  The OpenSSL API we were using to
  load CRLs won't actually load them from a directory, only a file.
  We now scan the directory ourselves and load the files one-by-one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed the verification flags being set on the certificate store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the CRL_CHECK_ALL flag as this was causing all certificates
  to be checked for CRL extensions and failing to verify the cert if
  there was none.  This basically caused all certs to fail when a CRL
  was provided via crl_file or crl_path.</li>
<li>Added the EXTENDED_CRL_SUPPORT flag as it is required to handle
  indirect CRLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new CLI command...
  <code>stir_shaken verify certificate_file &lt;certificate_file&gt; [ &lt;profile&gt; ]</code>
  which will assist troubleshooting certificate problems by allowing
  the user to manually verify a certificate file against either the
  global verification certificate store or the store for a specific
  profile.</p>

<p>Updated the XML documentation and the sample config file.</p>

<h4>bridge_softmix: Fix queueing VIDUPDATE control frames</h4>

<p>softmix_bridge_write_control() now calls ast_bridge_queue_everyone_else()
  with the bridge_channel so the VIDUPDATE control frame isn't echoed back.</p>
<p>softmix_bridge_write_control() was setting bridge_channel to NULL
  when calling ast_bridge_queue_everyone_else() for VIDUPDATE control
  frames.  This was causing the frame to be echoed back to the
  channel it came from.  In certain cases, like when two channels or
  bridges are being recorded, this can cause a ping-pong effect that
  floods the system with VIDUPDATE control frames.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_path.c: Fix path when dialing using PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS()</h4>
<p>Author: Igor Goncharovsky
  Date:   2024-05-12</p>
<p>When using the PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS() function for use in the Dial()
  command, the contacts are returned in text form, so the input to
  the path_outgoing_request() function is a contact value of NULL.
  The issue was reported in ASTERISK-28211, but was not actually fixed
  in ASTERISK-30100. This fix brings back the code that was previously
  removed and adds code to search for a contact to extract the path
  value from it.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_sdp_rtp: Add support for default/mismatched 8K RFC 4733/2833 digits</h4>

<p>After change made in 624f509 to add support for non 8K RFC 4733/2833 digits,
  Asterisk would only accept RFC 4733/2833 offers that matched the sample rate of
  the negotiated codec(s).</p>
<p>This change allows Asterisk to accept 8K RFC 4733/2833 offers if the UAC
  offfers 8K RFC 4733/2833 but negotiates for a non 8K bitrate codec.</p>
<p>A number of corresponding tests in tests/channels/pjsip/dtmf_sdp also needed to

<h4>security_agreement.c: Always add the Require and Proxy-Require headers</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-03</p>
<p>The <code>Require: mediasec</code> and <code>Proxy-Require: mediasec</code> headers need
  to be sent whenever we send <code>Security-Client</code> or <code>Security-Verify</code>
  headers but the logic to do that was only in add_security_headers()
  in res_pjsip_outbound_register.  So while we were sending them on
  REGISTER requests, we weren't sending them on INVITE requests.</p>
<p>This commit moves the logic to send the two headers out of
  res_pjsip_outbound_register:add_security_headers() and into
  security_agreement:ast_sip_add_security_headers().  This way
  they're always sent when we send <code>Security-Client</code> or

<h4>stasis_channels: Use uniqueid and name to delete old snapshots</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-05-08</p>
<p>Whenver a new channel snapshot is created or when a channel is
  destroyed, we need to delete any existing channel snapshot from
  the snapshot cache.  Historically, we used the channel-&gt;snapshot
  pointer to delete any existing snapshots but this has two issues.</p>
<p>First, if something (possibly ast_channel_internal_swap_snapshots)
  sets channel-&gt;snapshot to NULL while there's still a snapshot in
  the cache, we wouldn't be able to delete it and it would be orphaned
  when the channel is destroyed.  Since we use the cache to list
  channels from the CLI, AMI and ARI, it would appear as though the
  channel was still there when it wasn't.</p>
<p>Second, since there are actually two caches, one indexed by the
  channel's uniqueid, and another indexed by the channel's name,
  deleting from the caches by pointer requires a sequential search of
  all of the hash table buckets in BOTH caches to find the matching
  snapshots.  Not very efficient.</p>
<p>So, we now delete from the caches using the channel's uniqueid
  and name.  This solves both issues.</p>
<p>This doesn't address how channel-&gt;snapshot might have been set
  to NULL in the first place because although we have concrete
  evidence that it's happening, we haven't been able to reproduce it.</p>

<h4>app_voicemail_odbc: Allow audio to be kept on disk</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-04-09</p>
<p>This commit adds a new voicemail.conf option 'odbc_audio_on_disk'
  which when set causes the ODBC variant of app_voicemail to leave
  the message and greeting audio files on disk and only store the
  message metadata in the database.  This option came from a concern
  that the database could grow to large and cause remote access
  and/or replication to become slow.  In a clustering situation
  with this option, all asterisk instances would share the same
  database for the metadata and either use a shared filesystem
  or other filesystem replication service much more suitable
  for synchronizing files.</p>
<p>The changes to app_voicemail to implement this feature were actually
  quite small but due to the complexity of the module, the actual
  source code changes were greater.  They fall into the following
  categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tracing.  The module is so complex that it was impossible to
  figure out the path taken for various scenarios without the addition
  of many SCOPE_ENTER, SCOPE_EXIT and ast_trace statements, even in
  code that's not related to the functional change.  Making this worse
  was the fact that many "if" statements in this module didn't use
  braces.  Since the tracing macros add multiple statements, many "if"
  statements had to be converted to use braces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive use of PATH_MAX.  Previous maintainers of this module
  used PATH_MAX to allocate character arrays for filesystem paths
  and SQL statements as though they cost nothing.  In fact, PATH_MAX
  is defined as 4096 bytes!  Some functions had (and still have)
  multiples of these.  One function has 7.  Given that the vast
  majority of installations use the default spool directory path
  <code>/var/spool/asterisk/voicemail</code>, the actual path length is usually
  less than 80 bytes.  That's over 4000 bytes wasted.  It was the
  same for SQL statement buffers.  A 4K buffer for statement that
  only needed 60 bytes.  All of these PATH_MAX allocations in the
  ODBC related code were changed to dynamically allocated buffers.
  The rest will have to be addressed separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug fixes.  During the development of this feature, several
  pre-existing ODBC related bugs were discovered and fixed.  They
  had to do with leaving orphaned files on disk, not preserving
  original message ids when moving messages between folders,
  not honoring the "formats" config parameter in certain circumstances,
  etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>UserNote: This commit adds a new voicemail.conf option
  'odbc_audio_on_disk' which when set causes the ODBC variant of
  app_voicemail_odbc to leave the message and greeting audio files
  on disk and only store the message metadata in the database.
  Much more information can be found in the voicemail.conf.sample
  file.</p>
<h4>bridge_basic.c: Make sure that ast_bridge_channel is not destroyed while iterating over bridge-&gt;channels.

Therefore, locking the bridge before iterating over bridge-&gt;channels can resolve the race condition.</h4>

<h4>rtp_engine: add support for multirate RFC2833 digits</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2024-04-08</p>
<p>Add RFC2833 DTMF support for 16K, 24K, and 32K bitrate codecs.</p>
<p>Asterisk currently treats RFC2833 Digits as a single rtp payload type
  with a fixed bitrate of 8K.  This change would expand that to 8, 16,
  24 and 32K.</p>
<p>This requires checking the offered rtp types for any of these bitrates
  and then adding an offer for each (if configured for RFC2833.)  DTMF
  generation must also be changed in order to look at the current outbound
  codec in order to generate appropriately timed rtp.</p>
<p>For cases where no outgoing audio has yet been sent prior to digit
  generation, Asterisk now has a concept of a 'preferred' codec based on
  offer order.</p>
<p>On inbound calls Asterisk will mimic the payload types of the RFC2833
  digits.</p>
<p>On outbound calls Asterisk will choose the next free payload types starting
  with 101.</p>
<p>UserNote: No change in configuration is required in order to enable this
  feature. Endpoints configured to use RFC2833 will automatically have this
  enabled. If the endpoint does not support this, it should not include it in
  the SDP offer/response.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_logger: Preserve logging state on reloads.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-08-09</p>
<p>Currently, reloading res_pjsip will cause logging
  to be disabled. This is because logging can also
  be controlled via the debug option in pjsip.conf
  and this defaults to "no".</p>
<p>To improve this, logging is no longer disabled on
  reloads if logging had not been previously
  enabled using the debug option from the config.
  This ensures that logging enabled from the CLI
  will persist through a reload.</p>
<p>ASTERISK-29912 #close</p>
<p>Resolves: #246</p>
<p>UserNote: Issuing "pjsip reload" will no longer disable
  logging if it was previously enabled from the CLI.</p>

<h4>loader.c: Allow dependent modules to be unloaded recursively.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-12-02</p>
<p>Because of the (often recursive) nature of module dependencies in
  Asterisk, hot swapping a module on the fly is cumbersome if a module
  is depended on by other modules. Currently, dependencies must be
  popped manually by unloading dependents, unloading the module of
  interest, and then loading modules again in reverse order.</p>
<p>To make this easier, the ability to do this recursively in certain
  circumstances has been added, as an optional extension to the
  "module refresh" command. If requested, Asterisk will check if a module
  that has a positive usecount could be unloaded safely if anything
  recursively dependent on it were unloaded. If so, it will go ahead
  and unload all these modules and load them back again. This makes
  hot swapping modules that provide dependencies much easier.</p>
<p>Resolves: #474</p>
<p>UserNote: In certain circumstances, modules with dependency relations
  can have their dependents automatically recursively unloaded and loaded
  again using the "module refresh" CLI command or the ModuleLoad AMI command.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: Initial RTP inactivity check must consider the rtp_timeout setting.</h4>
<p>Author: Henrik Liljedahl
  Date:   2024-04-11</p>
<p>First rtp activity check was performed after 500ms regardless of the rtp_timeout setting. Having a call in ringing state for more than rtp_timeout and the first rtp package is received more than 500ms after sdp negotiation and before the rtp_timeout, erronously caused the call to be hungup. Changed to perform the first rtp inactivity check after the timeout setting preventing calls to be disconnected before the rtp_timeout has elapsed since sdp negotiation.</p>

<h4>callerid.c: Parse previously ignored Caller ID parameters.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-04-01</p>
<p>Commit f2f397c1a8cc48913434ebb297f0ff50d96993db previously
  made it possible to send Caller ID parameters to FXS stations
  which, prior to that, could not be sent.</p>
<p>This change is complementary in that we now handle receiving
  all these parameters on FXO lines and provide these up to
  the dialplan, via chan_dahdi. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a redirecting reason is provided, the channel's redirecting
    reason is set. No redirecting number is set, since there is
    no parameter for this in the Caller ID protocol, but the reason
    can be checked to determine if and why a call was forwarded.</li>
<li>If the Call Qualifier parameter is received, the Call Qualifier
    variable is set.</li>
<li>Some comments have been added to explain why some of the code
    is the way it is, to assist other people looking at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this change, Asterisk's Caller ID implementation is now
  reasonably complete for both FXS and FXO operation.</p>

<h4>logger.h:  Add SCOPE_CALL and SCOPE_CALL_WITH_RESULT</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-04-09</p>
<p>If you're tracing a large function that may call another function
  multiple times in different circumstances, it can be difficult to
  see from the trace output exactly which location that function
  was called from.  There's no good way to automatically determine
  the calling location.  SCOPE_CALL and SCOPE_CALL_WITH_RESULT
  simply print out a trace line before and after the call.</p>
<p>The difference between SCOPE_CALL and SCOPE_CALL_WITH_RESULT is
  that SCOPE_CALL ignores the function's return value (if any) where
  SCOPE_CALL_WITH_RESULT allows you to specify the type of the
  function's return value so it can be assigned to a variable.
  SCOPE_CALL_WITH_INT_RESULT is just a wrapper for SCOPE_CALL_WITH_RESULT
  and the "int" return type.</p>

<h4>rtp_engine and stun: call ast_register_atexit instead of ast_register_cleanup</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-04-02</p>
<p>rtp_engine.c and stun.c were calling ast_register_cleanup which
  is skipped if any loadable module can't be cleanly unloaded
  when asterisk shuts down.  Since this will always be the case,
  their cleanup functions never get run.  In a practical sense
  this makes no difference since asterisk is shutting down but if
  you're in development mode and trying to use the leak sanitizer,
  the leaks from both of those modules clutter up the output.</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenSSL 1.0.2 doesn't support X509_get0_pubkey so we now use

    RAII_VAR do that.</li>
<li>OpenSSL 1.0.2 doesn't support upreffing an X509_STORE so we now
    wrap it in an ao2 object.</li>
<li>OpenSSL 1.0.2 doesn't support X509_STORE_get0_objects to get all
    the certs from an X509_STORE and there's no easy way to polyfill

<p>UserNote: this new feature let users match endpoints based on the

  endpoint's 'identify_by' option. The 'match_request_uri' option of
  the identify can be an exact match for the entire request uri, or a
  regular expression (between slashes). It's quite similar to the
  header identifer.</p>

<h4>Implement Configurable TCP Keepalive Settings in PJSIP Transports</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua Elson
  Date:   2024-03-18</p>
<p>This commit introduces configurable TCP keepalive settings for both TCP and TLS transports. The changes allow for finer control over TCP connection keepalives, enhancing stability and reliability in environments prone to connection timeouts or where intermediate devices may prematurely close idle connections. This has proven necessary and has already been tested in production in several specialized environments where access to the underlying transport is unreliable in ways invisible to the operating system directly, so these keepalive and timeout mechanisms are necessary.</p>
<p>Fixes #657</p>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Don't retry opening nonexistent channels on restart.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-03-26</p>
<p>Commit 729cb1d390b136ccc696430aa5c68d60ea4028be added logic to retry
  opening DAHDI channels on "dahdi restart" if they failed initially,
  up to 1,000 times in a loop, to address cases where the channel was
  still in use. However, this retry loop does not use the actual error,
  which means chan_dahdi will also retry opening nonexistent channels
  1,000 times per channel, causing a flood of unnecessary warning logs
  for an operation that will never succeed, with tens or hundreds of
  thousands of open attempts being made.</p>
<p>The original patch would have been more targeted if it only retried
  on the specific relevant error (likely EBUSY, although it's hard to
  say since the original issue is no longer available).</p>
<p>To avoid the problem above while avoiding the possibility of breakage,
  this skips the retry logic if the error is ENXIO (No such device or
  address), since this will never succeed.</p>

<h4>alembic: Fix compatibility with SQLAlchemy 2.0+.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright

  causing the final <code>UPDATE</code> to our <code>alembic_version_&lt;whatever&gt;</code> tables

<p>We now use one connection to determine which
  <code>alembic_version_&lt;whatever&gt;</code> table to use and another to run the
  actual migrations. This prevents the erroneous rollback.</p>
<p>This change is compatible with both SQLAlchemy 1.4 and 2.0.</p>
<h4>manager.c: Add new parameter 'PreDialGoSub' to Originate AMI action</h4>
<p>Author: jonatascalebe
  Date:   2024-03-14</p>
<p>manager.c: Add new parameter 'PreDialGoSub' to Originate AMI action</p>
<p>The action originate does not has the ability to run an subroutine at initial channel, like the Aplication Originate. This update give this ability for de action originate too.</p>
<p>For example, we can run a routine via Gosub on the channel to request an automatic answer, so the caller does not need to accept the call when using the originate command via manager, making the operation more efficient.</p>
<p>UserNote: When using the Originate AMI Action, we now can pass the PreDialGoSub parameter, instructing the asterisk to perform an subrouting at channel before call start. With this parameter an call initiated by AMI can request the channel to start the call automaticaly, adding a SIP header to using GoSUB, instructing to autoanswer the channel, and proceeding the outbuound extension executing. Exemple of an context to perform the previus indication:
  [addautoanswer]
  exten =&gt; _s,1,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,Call-Info)=answer-after=0)
  exten =&gt; _s,n,Set(PJSIP_HEADER(add,Alert-Info)=answer-after=0)

<h4>res_prometheus: Fix duplicate output of metric and help text</h4>
<p>Author: Holger Hans Peter Freyther
  Date:   2024-02-24</p>
<p>The prometheus exposition format requires each line to be unique[1].
  This is handled by struct prometheus_metric having a list of children
  that is managed when registering a metric. In case the scrape callback
  is used, it is the responsibility of the implementation to handle this
  correctly.</p>
<p>Originally the bridge callback didn't handle NULL snapshots, the crash
  fix lead to NULL metrics, and fixing that lead to duplicates.</p>
<p>The original code assumed that snapshots are not NULL and then relied on
  "if (i &gt; 0)" to establish the parent/children relationship between
  metrics of the same class. This is not workerable as the first bridge
  might be invisible/lacks a snapshot.</p>
<p>Fix this by keeping a separate array of the first metric by class.
  Instead of relying on the index of the bridge, check whether the array
  has an entry. Use that array for the output.</p>
<p>Add a test case that verifies that the help text is not duplicated.</p>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Allow specifying waitfordialtone per call.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-12-02</p>
<p>The existing "waitfordialtone" setting in chan_dahdi.conf
  applies permanently to a specific channel, regardless of
  how it is being used. This rather restrictively prevents
  a system from simultaneously being able to pick free lines
  for outgoing calls while also allowing barge-in to a trunk
  by some other arrangement.</p>
<p>This allows specifying "waitfordialtone" using the CHANNEL
  function for only the next call that will be placed, allowing
  significantly more flexibility in the use of trunk interfaces.</p>
<p>Resolves: #472</p>
<p>UserNote: "waitfordialtone" may now be specified for DAHDI
  trunk channels on a per-call basis using the CHANNEL function.</p>
<h4>res_parking: Fail gracefully if parking lot is full.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-03-03</p>
<p>Currently, if a parking lot is full, bridge setup returns -1,

  However, such failures should be handled more gracefully,
  the same way they are on other paths, as indicated by the
  module's author, here:</p>
<p>http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2018-December/077144.html</p>
<p>Now, callers will hear the parking failure announcement, and dialplan
  will continue, which is consistent with existing failure modes.</p>

<h4>app_voicemail: Properly reinitialize config after unit tests.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-02-29</p>
<p>Most app_voicemail unit tests were not properly cleaning up
  after themselves after running. This led to test mailboxes
  lingering around in the system. It also meant that if any
  unit tests in app_voicemail that create mailboxes were executed
  and the module was not unloaded/loaded again prior to running
  the test_voicemail_vm_info unit test, Asterisk would segfault
  due to an attempt to copy a NULL string.</p>
<p>The load_config test did actually have logic to reinitialize
  the config after the test. However, this did not work in practice
  since load_config() would not reload the config since voicemail.conf
  had not changed during the test; thus, additional logic has been
  added to ensure that voicemail.conf is truly reloaded, after any
  unit tests which modify the users list.</p>
<p>This prevents the SEGV due to invalid mailboxes lingering around,
  and also ensures that the system state is restored to what it was
  prior to the tests running.</p>

<p>The original stir/shaken implementation was started over 3 years ago
  when little was understood about practical implementation.  The
  result was an implementation that wouldn't actually interoperate
  with any other stir-shaken implementations.</p>
<p>There were also a number of stir-shaken features and RFC
  requirements that were never implemented such as TNAuthList
  certificate validation, sending Reason headers in SIP responses
  when verification failed but we wished to continue the call, and
  the ability to send Media Key(mky) grants in the Identity header
  when the call involved DTLS.</p>
<p>Finally, there were some performance concerns around outgoing
  calls and selection of the correct certificate and private key.
  The configuration was keyed by an arbitrary name which meant that
  for every outgoing call, we had to scan the entire list of
  configured TNs to find the correct cert to use.  With only a few
  TNs configured, this wasn't an issue but if you have a thousand,
  it could be.</p>
<p>What's changed?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuration objects have been refactored to be clearer about
    their uses and to fix issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>The "general" object was renamed to "verification" since it
    contains parameters specific to the incoming verification
    process.  It also never handled ca_path and crl_path
    correctly.</li>
<li>A new "attestation" object was added that controls the
    outgoing attestation process.  It sets default certificates,
    keys, etc.</li>
<li>The "certificate" object was renamed to "tn" and had it's key
    change to telephone number since outgoing call attestation
    needs to look up certificates by telephone number.</li>
<li>The "profile" object had more parameters added to it that can
    override default parameters specified in the "attestation"
    and "verification" objects.</li>
<li>The "store" object was removed altogther as it was never
    implemented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now use libjwt to create outgoing Identity headers and to
    parse and validate signatures on incoming Identiy headers.  Our
    previous custom implementation was much of the source of the
    interoperability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General code cleanup and refactor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moved things to better places.</li>
<li>Separated some of the complex functions to smaller ones.</li>
<li>Using context objects rather than passing tons of parameters
    in function calls.</li>
<li>Removed some complexity and unneeded encapsuation from the
    config objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolves: #351
  Resolves: #46</p>
<p>UserNote: Asterisk's stir-shaken feature has been refactored to
  correct interoperability, RFC compliance, and performance issues.
  See https://docs.asterisk.org/Deployment/STIR-SHAKEN for more
  information.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: The stir-shaken refactor is a breaking change but since
  it's not working now we don't think it matters. The
  stir_shaken.conf file has changed significantly which means that
  existing ones WILL need to be changed.  The stir_shaken.conf.sample
  file in configs/samples/ has quite a bit more information.  This is
  also an ABI breaking change since some of the existing objects
  needed to be changed or removed, and new ones added.  Additionally,
  if res_stir_shaken is enabled in menuselect, you'll need to either
  have the development package for libjwt v1.15.3 installed or use
  the --with-libjwt-bundled option with ./configure.</p>
<h4>translate.c: implement new direct comp table mode</h4>
<p>Author: Sebastian Jennen
  Date:   2024-02-25</p>
<p>The new mode lists for each codec translation the actual real cost in cpu microseconds per second translated audio.
  This allows to compare the real cpu usage of translations and helps in evaluation of codec implementation changes regarding performance (regression testing).</p>
<ul>
<li>add new table mode</li>
<li>hide the 999999 comp values, as these only indicate an issue with transcoding</li>
<li>hide the 0 values, as these also do not contain any information (only indicate a multistep transcoding)</li>
</ul>

<h4>strings.h: Ensure ast_str_buffer(…) returns a 0 terminated string.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2024-02-17</p>
<p>If a dynamic string is created with an initial length of 0,
  <code>ast_str_buffer(…)</code> will return an invalid pointer.</p>
<p>This was a secondary discovery when fixing #65.</p>
<h4>res_rtp_asterisk.c: Correct coefficient in MOS calculation.</h4>
<p>Author: romryz
  Date:   2024-02-06</p>
<p>Media Experience Score relies on incorrect pseudo_mos variable
  calculation. According to forming an opinion section of the
  documentation, calculation relies on ITU-T G.107 standard:</p>
<pre><code>  https://docs.asterisk.org/Deployment/Media-Experience-Score/#forming-an-opinion
</code></pre>
<p>ITU-T G.107 Annex B suggests to calculate MOS with a coefficient
  "seven times ten to the power of negative six", 7 * 10^(-6). which
  would mean 6 digits after the decimal point. Current implementation
  has 7 digits after the decimal point, which downrates the calls.</p>

<h4>dsp.c: Fix and improve potentially inaccurate log message.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-02-09</p>
<p>If ast_dsp_process is called with a codec besides slin, ulaw,
  or alaw, a warning is logged that in-band DTMF is not supported,
  but this message is not always appropriate or correct, because
  ast_dsp_process is much more generic than just DTMF detection.</p>
<p>This logs a more generic message in those cases, and also improves
  codec-mismatch logging throughout dsp.c by ensuring incompatible
  codecs are printed out.</p>

<h4>pjsip show channelstats: Prevent possible segfault when faxing</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-02-09</p>
<p>Under rare circumstances, it's possible for the original audio
  session in the active_media_state default_session to be corrupted
  instead of removed when switching to the t38/image media session
  during fax negotiation.  This can cause a segfault when a "pjsip
  show channelstats" attempts to print that audio media session's
  rtp statistics.  In these cases, the active_media_state
  topology is correctly showing only a single t38/image stream
  so we now check that there's an audio stream in the topology
  before attempting to use the audio media session to get the rtp
  statistics.</p>
<p>Resolves: #592</p>
<h4>Reduce startup/shutdown verbose logging</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-01-31</p>
<p>When started with a verbose level of 3, asterisk can emit over 1500
  verbose message that serve no real purpose other than to fill up
  logs. When asterisk shuts down, it emits another 1100 that are of
  even less use. Since the testsuite runs asterisk with a verbose
  level of 3, and asterisk starts and stops for every one of the 700+
  tests, the number of log messages is staggering.  Besides taking up
  resources, it also makes it hard to debug failing tests.</p>
<p>This commit changes the log level for those verbose messages to 5
  instead of 3 which reduces the number of log messages to only a
  handful. Of course, NOTICE, WARNING and ERROR message are
  unaffected.</p>
<p>There's also one other minor change...
  ast_context_remove_extension_callerid2() logs a DEBUG message
  instead of an ERROR if the extension you're deleting doesn't exist.
  The pjsip_config_wizard calls that function to clean up the config
  and has been triggering that annoying error message for years.</p>

<h4>configure: Rerun bootstrap on modern platform.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-02-08</p>
<p>The last time configure was run, it was run on a system that
  did not enable -std=gnu11 by default, which meant that the
  restrict qualifier would not be recognized on certain platforms.
  This regenerates the configure files from running bootstrap.sh,
  so that these should be recognized on all supported platforms.</p>

<h4>app_speech_utils.c: Allow partial speech results.</h4>
<p>Author: cmaj
  Date:   2024-02-02</p>
<p>Adds 'p' option to SpeechBackground() application.
  With this option, when the app timeout is reached,
  whatever the backend speech engine collected will
  be returned as if it were the final, full result.
  (This works for engines that make partial results.)</p>
<p>Resolves: #572</p>
<p>UserNote: The SpeechBackground dialplan application now supports a 'p'
  option that will return partial results from speech engines that
  provide them when a timeout occurs.</p>
<h4>res_pjsip_outbound_registration.c: Add User-Agent header override</h4>
<p>Author: Flole998

<p>This introduces a setting for outbound registrations to override the
  global User-Agent header setting.</p>
<p>Resolves: #515</p>
<p>UserNote: PJSIP outbound registrations now support a per-registration
  User-Agent header</p>
<h4>utils: Make behavior of ast_strsep* match strsep.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2024-01-31</p>
<p>Given the scenario of passing an empty string to the
  ast_strsep functions the functions would return NULL
  instead of an empty string. This is counter to how
  strsep itself works.</p>
<p>This change alters the behavior of the functions to
  match that of strsep.</p>
<p>Fixes: #565</p>
<h4>app_chanspy: Add 'D' option for dual-channel audio</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2024-01-31</p>
<p>Adds the 'D' option to app chanspy that causes the input and output
  frames of the spied channel to be interleaved in the spy output frame.
  This allows the input and output of the spied channel to be decoded
  separately by the receiver.</p>
<p>If the 'o' option is also set, the 'D' option is ignored as the
  audio being spied is inherently one direction.</p>
<p>Fixes: #569</p>
<p>UserNote: The ChanSpy application now accepts the 'D' option which
  will interleave the spied audio within the outgoing frames. The
  purpose of this is to allow the audio to be read as a Dual channel
  stream with separate incoming and outgoing audio. Setting both the
  'o' option and the 'D' option and results in the 'D' option being
  ignored.</p>
<h4>app_if: Fix next priority calculation.</h4>

<p>Commit fa3922a4d28860d415614347d9f06c233d2beb07 fixed

<h4>res_pjsip_session.c: Correctly format SDP connection addresses.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2024-01-27</p>
<p>Resolves a regression identified by @justinludwig involving the
  rendering of IPv6 addresses in outgoing SDP.</p>
<p>Also updates <code>media_address</code> on PJSIP endpoints so that if we are able
  to parse the configured value as an IP we store it in a format that we
  can directly use later. Based on my reading of the code it appeared
  that one could configure <code>media_address</code> as:</p>
<p><code>[foo]
  type = endpoint
  ...
  media_address = [2001:db8::]</code></p>
<p>And that value would be blindly copied into the outgoing SDP without
  regard to its format.</p>
<p>Fixes #541</p>
<h4>rtp_engine.c: Correct sample rate typo for L16/44100.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright

<p>Fixes #555</p>
<h4>manager.c: Fix erroneous reloads in UpdateConfig.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-01-25</p>
<p>Currently, a reload will always occur if the
  Reload header is provided for the UpdateConfig
  action. However, we should not be doing a reload
  if the header value has a falsy value, per the
  documentation, so this makes the reload behavior
  consistent with the existing documentation.</p>

<h4>app_confbridge: Don't emit warnings on valid configurations.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2024-01-21</p>
<p>The numeric bridge profile options <code>internal_sample_rate</code> and
  <code>maximum_sample_rate</code> are documented to accept the special values
  <code>auto</code> and <code>none</code>, respectively. While these values currently work,
  they also emit warnings when used which could be confusing for users.</p>
<p>In passing, also ensure that we only accept the documented range of
  sample rate values between 8000 and 192000.</p>
<p>Fixes #546</p>
<h4>app_voicemail_odbc: remove macrocontext from voicemail_messages table</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2024-01-10</p>
<p>When app_macro was deprecated, the macrocontext column was removed from
  the INSERT statement but the binds were not renumbered. This broke the
  insert.</p>
<p>This change removes the macrocontext column via alembic and re-numbers
  the existing columns in the INSERT.</p>
<p>Fixes: #527</p>
<p>UserNote: The fix requires removing the macrocontext column from the
  voicemail_messages table in the voicemail database via alembic upgrade.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: The fix requires that the voicemail database be upgraded via
  alembic. Upgrading to the latest voicemail database via alembic will
  remove the macrocontext column from the voicemail_messages table.</p>
<h4>chan_dahdi: Allow MWI to be manually toggled on channels.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-11-10</p>
<p>This adds a CLI command to manually toggle the MWI status
  of a channel, useful for troubleshooting or resetting
  MWI devices, similar to the capabilities offered with
  SIP messaging to manually control MWI status.</p>
<p>UserNote: The 'dahdi set mwi' now allows MWI on channels
  to be manually toggled if needed for troubleshooting.</p>

<h4>logger: Fix linking regression.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2024-01-16</p>
<p>Commit 008731b0a4b96c4e6c340fff738cc12364985b64
  caused a regression by resulting in logger.xml
  being compiled and linked into the asterisk
  binary in lieu of logger.c on certain platforms
  if Asterisk was compiled in dev mode.</p>
<p>To fix this, we ensure the file has a unique
  name without the extension. Most existing .xml
  files have been named differently from any
  .c files in the same directory or did not
  pose this issue.</p>
<p>channels/pjsip/dialplan_functions.xml does not
  pose this issue but is also being renamed
  to adhere to this policy.</p>

<h4>app_if: Fix faulty EndIf branching.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-12-23</p>
<p>This fixes faulty branching logic for the

<p>Resolves: #341</p>
<h4>manager.c: Fix regression due to using wrong free function.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-12-26</p>
<p>Commit 424be345639d75c6cb7d0bd2da5f0f407dbd0bd5 introduced
  a regression by calling ast_free on memory allocated by
  realpath. This causes Asterisk to abort when executing this
  function. Since the memory is allocated by glibc, it should
  be freed using ast_std_free.</p>
<p>Resolves: #513</p>
<h4>res_rtp_asterisk: Fix regression issues with DTLS client check</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-12-15</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since ICE candidates are used for the check and pjproject is
    required to use ICE, res_rtp_asterisk was failing to compile
    when pjproject wasn't available.  The check is now wrapped
    with an #ifdef HAVE_PJPROJECT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rtp-&gt;ice_active_remote_candidates container was being
    used to check the address on incoming packets but that
    container doesn't contain peer reflexive candidates discovered
    during negotiation. This was causing the check to fail
    where it shouldn't.  We now check against pjproject's
    real_ice-&gt;rcand array which will contain those candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also fixed a bug in ast_sockaddr_from_pj_sockaddr() where
    we weren't zeroing out sin-&gt;sin_zero before returning.  This
    was causing ast_sockaddr_cmp() to always return false when
    one of the inputs was converted from a pj_sockaddr, even
    if both inputs had the same address and port.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_header_funcs: Duplicate new header value, don't copy.</h4>
<p>Author: Gitea
  Date:   2023-07-10</p>
<p>When updating an existing header the 'update' code incorrectly
  just copied the new value into the existing buffer. If the
  new value exceeded the available buffer size memory outside
  of the buffer would be written into, potentially causing
  a crash.</p>

<p>Fixes #470</p>
<h4>ast_coredumper: Increase reliability</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-11-11</p>
<p>Instead of searching for the asterisk binary and the modules in the
  filesystem, we now get their locations, along with libdir, from
  the coredump itself...</p>
<p>For the binary, we can use <code>gdb -c &lt;coredump&gt; ... "info proc exe"</code>.
  gdb can print this even without having the executable and symbols.</p>
<p>Once we have the binary, we can get the location of the modules with
  <code>gdb ... "print ast_config_AST_MODULE_DIR</code></p>
<p>If there was no result then either it's not an asterisk coredump
  or there were no symbols loaded.  Either way, it's not usable.</p>
<p>For libdir, we now run "strings" on the note0 section of the
  coredump (which has the shared library -&gt; memory address xref) and
  search for "libasteriskssl|libasteriskpj", then take the dirname.</p>
<p>Since we're now getting everything from the coredump, it has to be
  correct as long as we're not crossing namespace boundaries like
  running asterisk in a docker container but trying to run
  ast_coredumper from the host using a shared file system (which you
  shouldn't be doing).</p>
<p>There is still a case for using --asterisk-bin and/or --libdir: If
  you've updated asterisk since the coredump was taken, the binary,
  libraries and modules won't match the coredump which will render it
  useless.  If you can restore or rebuild the original files that
  match the coredump and place them in a temporary directory, you can
  use --asterisk-bin, --libdir, and a new --moddir option to point to
  them and they'll be correctly captured in a tarball created
  with --tarball-coredumps.  If you also use --tarball-config, you can
  use a new --etcdir option to point to what normally would be the
  /etc/asterisk directory.</p>

<h4>logger.c: Move LOG_GROUP documentation to dedicated XML file.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2023-12-01</p>
<p>The <code>get_documentation</code> awk script will only extract the first
  DOCUMENTATION block that it finds in a given file. This is by design
  (9bc2127) to prevent AMI event documentation from being pulled in to
  the core.xml documentation file.</p>
<p>Because of this, the <code>LOG_GROUP</code> documentation added in 89709e2 was
  not being properly extracted and was missing fom the resulting XML
  documentation file. This commit moves the <code>LOG_GROUP</code> documentation to
  a separate <code>logger.xml</code> file.</p>
<h4>res_odbc.c: Allow concurrent access to request odbc connections</h4>
<p>Author: Matthew Fredrickson
  Date:   2023-11-30</p>
<p>There are valid scenarios where res_odbc's connection pool might have some dead
  or stuck connections while others are healthy (imagine network
  elements/firewalls/routers silently timing out connections to a single DB and a
  single IP address, or a heterogeneous connection pool connected to potentially
  multiple IPs/instances of a replicated DB using a DNS front end for load
  balancing and one replica fails).</p>
<p>In order to time out those unhealthy connections without blocking access to
  other parts of Asterisk that may attempt access to the connection pool, it would
  be beneficial to not lock/block access around the entire pool in
  _ast_odbc_request_obj2 while doing potentially blocking operations on connection
  pool objects such as the connection_dead() test, odbc_obj_connect(), or by
  dereferencing a struct odbc_obj for the last time and triggering a
  odbc_obj_disconnect().</p>
<p>This would facilitate much quicker and concurrent timeout of dead connections
  via the connection_dead() test, which could block potentially for a long period
  of time depending on odbc.ini or other odbc connector specific timeout settings.</p>
<p>This also would make rapid failover (in the clustered DB scenario) much quicker.</p>
<p>This patch changes the locking in _ast_odbc_request_obj2() to not lock around
  odbc_obj_connect(), _disconnect(), and connection_dead(), while continuing to
  lock around truly shared, non-immutable state like the connection_cnt member and
  the connections list on struct odbc_class.</p>

<h4>make_xml_documentation: Properly handle absolute LOCAL_MOD_SUBDIRS.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright

<h4>app_voicemail.c: Completely resequence mailbox folders.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2023-11-27</p>
<p>Resequencing is a process that occurs when we open a voicemail folder
  and discover that there are gaps between messages (e.g. <code>msg0000.txt</code>
  is missing but <code>msg0001.txt</code> exists). Resequencing involves shifting
  the existing messages down so we end up with a sequential list of
  messages.</p>
<p>Currently, this process stops after reaching a threshold based on the
  message limit (<code>maxmsg</code>) configured on the current folder. However, if
  <code>maxmsg</code> is lowered when a voicemail folder contains more than
  <code>maxmsg + 10</code> messages, resequencing will not run completely leaving
  the mailbox in an inconsistent state.</p>
<p>We now resequence up to the maximum number of messages permitted by
  <code>app_voicemail</code> (currently hard-coded at 9999 messages).</p>
<p>Fixes #86</p>
<h4>sig_analog: Fix channel leak when mwimonitor is enabled.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-11-24</p>
<p>When mwimonitor=yes is enabled for an FXO port,
  the do_monitor thread will launch mwi_thread if it thinks
  there could be MWI on an FXO channel, due to the noise
  threshold being satisfied. This, in turns, calls
  analog_ss_thread_start in sig_analog. However, unlike
  all other instances where __analog_ss_thread is called
  in sig_analog, this call path does not properly set
  pvt-&gt;ss_astchan to the Asterisk channel, which means
  that the Asterisk channel is NULL when __analog_ss_thread
  starts executing. As a result, the thread exits and the
  channel is never properly cleaned up by calling ast_hangup.</p>
<p>This caused issues with do_monitor on incoming calls,
  as it would think the channel was still owned even while
  receiving events, leading to an infinite barrage of
  warning messages; additionally, the channel would persist
  improperly.</p>
<p>To fix this, the assignment is added to the call path
  where it is missing (which is only used for mwi_thread).
  A warning message is also added since previously there
  was no indication that __analog_ss_thread was exiting
  abnormally. This resolves both the channel leak and the
  condition that led to the warning messages.</p>

<h4>chan_pjsip: Add PJSIPHangup dialplan app and manager action</h4>

<p>See UserNote below.</p>
<p>Exposed the existing Hangup AMI action in manager.c so we can use
  all of it's channel search and AMI protocol handling without
  duplicating that code in dialplan_functions.c.</p>
<p>Added a lookup function to res_pjsip.c that takes in the
  string represenation of the pjsip_status_code enum and returns
  the actual status code.  I.E.  ast_sip_str2rc("DECLINE") returns
  603.  This allows the caller to specify PJSIPHangup(decline) in
  the dialplan, just like Hangup(call_rejected).</p>
<p>Also extracted the XML documentation to its own file since it was
  almost as large as the code itself.</p>
<p>UserNote: A new dialplan app PJSIPHangup and AMI action allows you

<h4>core_local: Fix local channel parsing with slashes.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-08-09</p>
<p>Currently, trying to call a Local channel with a slash
  in the extension will fail due to the parsing of characters
  after such a slash as being dial modifiers. Additionally,
  core_local is inconsistent and incomplete with
  its parsing of Local dial strings in that sometimes it
  uses the first slash and at other times it uses the last.</p>
<p>For instance, something like DAHDI/5 or PJSIP/device
  is a perfectly usable extension in the dialplan, but Local
  channels in particular prevent these from being called.</p>
<p>This creates inconsistent behavior for users, since using
  a slash in an extension is perfectly acceptable, and using
  a Goto to accomplish this works fine, but if specified
  through a Local channel, the parsing prevents this.</p>
<p>This fixes this by explicitly parsing options from the
  last slash in the extension, rather than the first one,
  which doesn't cause an issue for extensions with slashes.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_exten_state,res_pjsip_mwi: Allow unload on shutdown</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-10-19</p>
<p>Commit f66f77f last year prevents the res_pjsip_exten_state and
  res_pjsip_mwi modules from unloading due to possible pjproject
  asserts if the modules are reloaded. A side effect of the
  implementation is that the taskprocessors these modules use aren't
  being released. When asterisk is doing a graceful shutdown, it
  waits AST_TASKPROCESSOR_SHUTDOWN_MAX_WAIT seconds for all
  taskprocessors to stop but since those 2 modules don't release
  theirs, the shutdown hangs for that amount of time.</p>
<p>This change allows the modules to be unloaded and their resources to
  be released when ast_shutdown_final is true.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip: Expanding PJSIP endpoint ID and relevant resource length to 255 characters</h4>
<p>Author: sungtae kim
  Date:   2023-09-23</p>
<p>This commit introduces an extension to the endpoint and relevant
  resource sizes for PJSIP, transitioning from its current 40-character
  constraint to a more versatile 255-character capacity. This enhancement
  significantly overcomes limitations related to domain qualification and
  practical usage, ultimately delivering improved functionality. In
  addition, it includes adjustments to accommodate the expanded realm size
  within the ARI, specifically enhancing the maximum realm length.</p>
<p>Resolves: #345</p>
<p>UserNote: With this update, the PJSIP realm lengths have been extended
  to support up to 255 characters.</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: As part of this update, the maximum allowable length
  for PJSIP endpoints and relevant resources has been increased from
  40 to 255 characters. To take advantage of this enhancement, it is
  recommended to run the necessary procedures (e.g., Alembic) to
  update your schemas.</p>
<h4>res_stasis: signal when new command is queued</h4>

<h4>Add libjwt to third-party</h4>

<p>A few tweaks were also made to the third-party infrastructure as
  a whole.  The jansson "dest" install directory was renamed "dist"
  to better match convention, and the third-party Makefile was updated

  causes the lock calls to loop over trylock in 200us intervals until
  the lock is obtained and spits out log messages if it takes more
  than 5 seconds.  From a code perspective, the only reason they were
  tied together was for logging.  So... The ifdefs in lock.c were
  refactored to allow DETECT_DEADLOCKS to be enabled without
  also enabling DEBUG_THREADS.</p>
<p>Resolves: #321</p>
<p>UserNote: You no longer need to select DEBUG_THREADS to use
  DETECT_DEADLOCKS.  This removes a significant amount of overhead
  if you just want to detect possible deadlocks vs needing full
  lock tracing.</p>
<h4>asterisk.c: Use the euid's home directory to read/write cli history</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-09-15</p>
<p>The CLI .asterisk_history file is read from/written to the directory
  specified by the HOME environment variable. If the root user starts
  asterisk with the -U/-G options, or with runuser/rungroup set in
  asterisk.conf, the asterisk process is started as root but then it
  calls setuid/setgid to set the new user/group. This does NOT reset
  the HOME environment variable to the new user's home directory
  though so it's still left as "/root". In this case, the new user
  will almost certainly NOT have access to read from or write to the
  history file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added function process_histfile() which calls
    getpwuid(geteuid()) and uses pw-&gt;dir as the home directory
    instead of the HOME environment variable.</li>
<li>ast_el_read_default_histfile() and ast_el_write_default_histfile()
    have been modified to use the new process_histfile()
    function.</li>

<h4>res_pjsip_transport_websocket: Prevent transport from being destroyed before message finishes.</h4>
<p>Author: Tinet-mucw
  Date:   2023-09-13</p>
<p>From the gdb information, ast_websocket_read reads a message successfully,
  then transport_read is called in the serializer. During execution of pjsip_transport_down,
  ws_session-&gt;stream-&gt;fd is closed; ast_websocket_read encounters an error and exits the while loop.
  After executing transport_shutdown, the transport's reference count becomes 0, causing a crash when sending SIP messages.
  This was due to pjsip_transport_dec_ref executing earlier than pjsip_rx_data_clone, leading to this issue.
  In websocket_cb executeing pjsip_transport_add_ref, this we now ensure the transport is not destroyed while in the loop.</p>

<h4>chan_console: Fix deadlock caused by unclean thread exit.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-09-09</p>
<p>To terminate a console channel, stop_stream causes pthread_cancel
  to make stream_monitor exit. However, commit 5b8fea93d106332bc0faa4b7fa8a6ea71e546cac
  added locking to this function which results in deadlock due to
  the stream_monitor thread being killed while it's holding the pvt lock.</p>
<p>To resolve this, a flag is now set and read to indicate abort, so
  the use of pthread_cancel and pthread_kill can be avoided altogether.</p>

<h4>file.c: Add ability to search custom dir for sounds</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-09-11</p>
<p>To better co-exist with sounds files that may be managed by
  packages, custom sound files may now be placed in
  AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/custom instead of the standard
  AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/<lang> directory.  If the new
  "sounds_search_custom_dir" option in asterisk.conf is set
  to "true", asterisk will search the custom directory for sounds
  files before searching the standard directory.  For performance
  reasons, the "sounds_search_custom_dir" defaults to "false".</p>
<p>Resolves: #315</p>
<p>UserNote: A new option "sounds_search_custom_dir" has been added to
  asterisk.conf that allows asterisk to search
  AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/custom for sounds files before searching the
  standard AST_DATA_DIR/sounds/<lang> directory.</p>

<h4>make_buildopts_h, et. al.  Allow adding all cflags to buildopts.h</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-09-13</p>
<p>The previous behavior of make_buildopts_h was to not add the
  non-ABI-breaking MENUSELECT_CFLAGS like DETECT_DEADLOCKS,
  REF_DEBUG, etc. to the buildopts.h file because "it caused
  ccache to invalidate files and extended compile times". They're
  only defined by passing them on the gcc command line with '-D'
  options.   In practice, including them in the include file rarely
  causes any impact because the only time ccache cares is if you
  actually change an option so the hit occurrs only once after
  you change it.</p>
<p>OK so why would we want to include them?  Many IDEs follow the
  include files to resolve defines and if the options aren't in an
  include file, it can cause the IDE to mark blocks of "ifdeffed"
  code as unused when they're really not.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a new menuselect compile option ADD_CFLAGS_TO_BUILDOPTS_H
    which tells make_buildopts_h to include the non-ABI-breaking
    flags in buildopts.h as well as the ABI-breaking ones. The default
    is disabled to preserve current behavior.  As before though,
    only the ABI-breaking flags appear in AST_BUILDOPTS and only
    those are used to calculate AST_BUILDOPT_SUM.
    A new AST_BUILDOPT_ALL define was created to capture all of the
    flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make_version_c was streamlined to use buildopts.h and also to
    create asterisk_build_opts_all[] and ast_get_build_opts_all(void)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"core show settings" now shows both AST_BUILDOPTS and
    AST_BUILDOPTS_ALL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>UserNote: The "Build Options" entry in the "core show settings"
  CLI command has been renamed to "ABI related Build Options" and
  a new entry named "All Build Options" has been added that shows
  both breaking and non-breaking options.</p>

  Date:   2023-08-31</p>
<p>Using the Set dialplan application does not actually

<p>This change adds two dialplan functions,

  of just setting them to empty.</p>
<p>There is also no ability within the dialplan to

<h4>res_pjsip_header_funcs: Make prefix argument optional.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-08-09</p>
<p>The documentation for PJSIP_HEADERS claims that
  prefix is optional, but in the code it is actually not.
  However, there is no inherent reason for this, as users
  may want to retrieve all header names, not just those
  beginning with a certain prefix.</p>
<p>This makes the prefix optional for this function,
  simply fetching all header names if not specified.
  As a result, the documentation is now correct.</p>
<p>Resolves: #230</p>
<p>UserNote: The prefix argument to PJSIP_HEADERS is now
  optional. If not specified, all header names will be
  returned.</p>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Allow autoreoriginating after hangup.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-08-04</p>
<p>Currently, if an FXS channel is still off hook when
  all calls on the line have hung up, the user is provided
  reorder tone until going back on hook again.</p>
<p>In addition to not reflecting what most commercial switches
  actually do, it's very common for switches to automatically
  reoriginate for the user so that dial tone is provided without
  the user having to depress and release the hookswitch manually.
  This can increase convenience for users.</p>
<p>This behavior is now supported for kewlstart FXS channels.
  It's supported only for kewlstart (FXOKS) mainly because the
  behavior doesn't make any sense for ground start channels,
  and loop start signalling doesn't provide the necessary DAHDI
  event that makes this easy to implement. Likely almost everyone
  is using FXOKS over FXOLS anyways since FXOLS is pretty useless
  these days.</p>
<p>ASTERISK-30357 #close</p>
<p>Resolves: #224</p>
<p>UserNote: The autoreoriginate setting now allows for kewlstart FXS
  channels to automatically reoriginate and provide dial tone to the
  user again after all calls on the line have cleared. This saves users
  from having to manually hang up and pick up the receiver again before
  making another call.</p>

<h4>app_queue: Add support for applying caller priority change immediately.</h4>
<p>Author: Joshua C. Colp
  Date:   2023-07-07</p>
<p>The app_queue module provides both an AMI action and a CLI command
  to change the priority of a caller in a queue. Up to now this change
  of priority has only been reflected to new callers into the queue.</p>
<p>This change adds an "immediate" option to both the AMI action and
  CLI command which immediately applies the priority change respective
  to the other callers already in the queue. This can allow, for example,
  a caller to be placed at the head of the queue immediately if their
  priority is sufficient.</p>
<p>Resolves: #202</p>
<p>UserNote: The 'queue priority caller' CLI command and
  'QueueChangePriorityCaller' AMI action now have an 'immediate'
  argument which allows the caller priority change to be reflected
  immediately, causing the position of a caller to move within the
  queue depending on the priorities of the other callers.</p>

<p>Within ast_rtcp_write(), the call to ast_rtp_rtcp_report_alloc() uses rtp-&gt;themssrc_valid,
  which is outside the protection of the rtp_instance lock. However,
  ast_rtcp_generate_report(), which is called by ast_rtcp_generate_compound_prefix(), uses
  rtp-&gt;themssrc_valid within the protection of the rtp_instance lock.</p>
<p>This can lead to the possibility that the value of rtp-&gt;themssrc_valid used in the call to
  ast_rtp_rtcp_report_alloc() may be different from the value of rtp-&gt;themssrc_valid used
  within ast_rtcp_generate_report().</p>

<h4>users.conf: Deprecate users.conf configuration.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-06-30</p>
<p>This deprecates the users.conf config file, which
  is no longer as widely supported but still integrated
  with a number of different modules.</p>
<p>Because there is no real mechanism for marking a
  configuration file as "deprecated", and users.conf
  is not just used in a single place, this now emits
  a warning to the user when the PBX loads to notify
  about the deprecation.</p>
<p>This configuration mechanism has been widely criticized
  and discouraged since its inception, and is no longer
  relevant to the configuration that most users are doing
  today. Removing it will allow for some simplification
  and cleanup in the codebase.</p>
<p>Resolves: #183</p>
<p>UpgradeNote: The users.conf config is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of Asterisk.</p>
<h4>sig_analog: Allow immediate fake ring to be suppressed.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-06-08</p>
<p>When immediate=yes on an FXS channel, sig_analog will
  start fake audible ringback that continues until the
  channel is answered. Even if it answers immediately,
  the ringback is still audible for a brief moment.
  This can be disruptive and unwanted behavior.</p>
<p>This adds an option to disable this behavior, though
  the default behavior remains unchanged.</p>

<h4>apply_patches: Use globbing instead of file/sort.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright
  Date:   2023-07-06</p>
<p>This accomplishes the same thing as a <code>find ... | sort</code> but with the

<h4>apply_patches: Sort patch list before applying</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2023-07-06</p>
<p>The apply_patches script wasn't sorting the list of patches in
  the "patches" directory before applying them. This left the list
  in an indeterminate order. In most cases, the list is actually
  sorted but rarely, they can be out of order and cause dependent
  patches to fail to apply.</p>
<p>We now sort the list but the "sort" program wasn't in the
  configure scripts so we needed to add that and regenerate
  the scripts as well.</p>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Fix broken hidecallerid setting. (#101)</h4>
<p>Author: InterLinked1
  Date:   2023-05-25</p>
<p>The hidecallerid setting in chan_dahdi.conf currently
  is broken for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>First, the actual code in sig_analog to "allow" or "block"
  Caller ID depending on this setting improperly used
  ast_set_callerid instead of updating the presentation.
  This issue was mostly fixed in ASTERISK_29991, and that
  fix is carried forward to this code as well.</p>
<p>Secondly, the hidecallerid setting is set on the DAHDI
  pvt but not carried forward to the analog pvt properly.
  This is because the chan_dahdi config loading code improperly
  set permhidecallerid to permhidecallerid from the config file,
  even though hidecallerid is what is actually set from the config
  file. (This is done correctly for call waiting, a few lines above.)
  This is fixed to read the proper value.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in sig_analog, hidecallerid is set to permhidecallerid
  only on hangup. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities
  as an allowed Caller ID from an initial call can "leak" into subsequent
  calls if no hangup occurs between them. This is fixed by setting
  hidecallerid to permcallerid when calls begin, rather than when they end.
  This also means we don't need to also set hidecallerid in chan_dahdi.c
  when copying from the config, as we would have to otherwise.</p>
<p>Fourthly, sig_analog currently only allows dialing <em>67 or </em>82 if
  that would actually toggle the presentation. A comment is added
  clarifying that this behavior is okay.</p>
<p>Finally, a couple log messages are updated to be more accurate.</p>

<p>Author: InterLinked1

<p>The existing res_pjsip_pubsub APIs are somewhat limited in
  what they can do. This adds a few API extensions that make
  it possible for PJSIP pubsub modules to implement richer
  features than is currently possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow pubsub modules to get a handle to pjsip_rx_data on subscription</li>
<li>Allow pubsub modules to run a callback when a subscription is renewed</li>

<h4>chan_dahdi: Add dialmode option for FXS lines.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-04-28</p>
<p>Currently, both pulse and tone dialing are always enabled
  on all FXS lines, with no way of disabling one or the other.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, it is desirable or necessary to
  disable one of these, and this behavior can be problematic.</p>
<p>A new "dialmode" option is added which allows setting the
  methods to support on a per channel basis for FXS (FXO
  signalled lines). The four options are "both", "pulse",
  "dtmf"/"tone", and "none".</p>
<p>Additionally, integration with the CHANNEL function is
  added so that this setting can be updated for a channel
  during a call.</p>
<p>Resolves: #35
  ASTERISK-29992</p>
<p>UserNote: A "dialmode" option has been added which allows
  specifying, on a per-channel basis, what methods of
  subscriber dialing (pulse and/or tone) are permitted.</p>
<p>Additionally, this can be changed on a channel
  at any point during a call using the CHANNEL
  function.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_stir_shaken: Fix JSON field ordering and disallowed TN characters.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2023-02-17</p>
<p>The current STIR/SHAKEN signing process is inconsistent with the
  RFCs in a couple ways that can cause interoperability issues.</p>
<p>RFC8225 specifies that the keys must be ordered lexicographically, but
  currently the fields are simply ordered according to the order
  in which they were added to the JSON object, which is not
  compliant with the RFC and can cause issues with some carriers.</p>
<p>To fix this, we now leverage libjansson's ability to dump a JSON
  object sorted by key value, yielding the correct field ordering.</p>
<p>Additionally, telephone numbers must have any leading + prefix removed
  and must not contain characters outside of 0-9, *, and # in order
  to comply with the RFCs. Numbers are now properly formatted as such.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_pubsub: subscription cleanup changes</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2023-03-29</p>
<p>There are two main parts of the change associated with this
  commit. These are driven by the change in call order of
  pubsub_on_rx_refresh and pubsub_on_evsub_state by pjproject
  when an in-dialog SUBSCRIBE is received.</p>
<p>First, the previous behavior was for pjproject to call
  pubsub_on_rx_refresh before calling pubsub_on_evsub_state
  when an in-dialog SUBSCRIBE was received that changes the
  subscription state.</p>
<p>If that change was a termination due to a re-SUBSCRIBE with
  an expires of 0, we used to use the call to pubsub_on_rx_refresh
  to set the substate of the evsub to TERMINATE_PENDING before
  pjproject could call pubsub_on_evsub_state.</p>
<p>This substate let pubsub_on_evsub_state know that the
  subscription TERMINATED event could be ignored as there was
  still a subsequent NOTIFY that needed to be generated and
  another call to pubsub_on_evsub_state to come with it.</p>
<p>That NOTIFY was sent via serialized_pubsub_on_refresh_timeout
  which would see the TERMINATE_PENDING state and transition it
  to TERMINATE_IN_PROGRESS before triggering another call to
  pubsub_on_evsub_state (which now would clean up the evsub.)</p>
<p>The new pjproject behavior is to call pubsub_on_evsub_state
  before pubsub_on_rx_refresh. This means we no longer can set
  the state to TERMINATE_PENDING to tell pubsub_on_evsub_state
  that it can ignore the first TERMINATED event.</p>
<p>To handle this, we now look directly at the event type,
  method type and the expires value to determine whether we
  want to ignore the event or use it to trigger the evsub
  cleanup.</p>
<p>Second, pjproject now expects the NOTIFY to actually be sent
  during pubsub_on_rx_refresh and avoids the protocol violation
  inherent in sending a NOTIFY before the SUBSCRIBE is
  acknowledged by caching the sent NOTIFY then sending it
  after responding to the SUBSCRIBE.</p>
<p>This requires we send the NOTIFY using the non-serialized
  pubsub_on_refresh_timeout directly and let pjproject handle
  the protocol violation.</p>

<h4>ael: Regenerate lexers and parsers.</h4>
<p>Author: Sean Bright

<p>Various changes to ensure that the lexers and parsers can be correctly
  generated when REBUILD_PARSERS is enabled.</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because of the version of flex we are using to generate the lexers
    (2.5.35) some post-processing in the Makefile is still required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generated lexers do not contain the problematic C99 check that
    was being replaced by the call to sed in the respective Makefiles so
    it was removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since these files are generated, they will include trailing
    whitespace in some places. This does not need to be corrected.</p>

<h4>res_mixmonitor: MixMonitorMute by MixMonitor ID</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2023-03-13</p>
<p>While it is possible to create multiple mixmonitor instances
  on a channel, it was not previously possible to mute individual
  instances.</p>
<p>This change includes the ability to specify the MixMonitorID
  when calling the manager action: MixMonitorMute.  This will
  allow an individual MixMonitor instance to be muted via id.
  This id can be stored as a channel variable using the 'i'
  MixMonitor option.</p>
<p>As part of this change, if no MixMonitorID is specified in
  the manager action MixMonitorMute, Asterisk will set the mute
  flag on all MixMonitor spy-type audiohooks on the channel.
  This is done via the new audiohook function:
  ast_audiohook_set_mute_all.</p>

<p>The intent of which is to execute:</p>
<pre><code>${DAEMON} -rx "core stop now"
</code></pre>
<p>While sending both stdout and stderr to <code>/dev/null</code>. Unfortunately,
  because the <code>&amp;</code> is in the wrong place, bash is interpreting the <code>2</code> as
  just an additional argument to the <code>$DAEMON</code> command and not as a file
  descriptor and proceeds to use the bashism <code>&amp;&gt;</code> to send stderr and
  stdout to a file named <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>So we clean it up and just use bash's shortcut syntax.</p>

<h4>chan_iax2: Fix jitterbuffer regression prior to receiving audio.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-12-14</p>
<p>ASTERISK_29392 (a security fix) introduced a regression by
  not processing frames when we don't have an audio format.</p>
<p>Currently, chan_iax2 only calls jb_get to read frames from
  the jitterbuffer when the voiceformat has been set on the pvt.
  However, this only happens when we receive a voice frame, which
  means that prior to receiving voice frames, other types of frames
  get stalled completely in the jitterbuffer.</p>
<p>To fix this, we now fallback to using the format negotiated during
  call setup until we've actually received a voice frame with a format.
  This ensures we're always able to read from the jitterbuffer.</p>

  so the sub tree deletion that used to take place in
  on_evsub_state() now must take place in on_rx_refresh().</p>
<p>Additionally, pjsip now requires that you send the NOTIFY
  from within on_rx_refresh(), otherwise it will assert
  when going to send the 200 OK. The idea is that it will
  look for this NOTIFY and cache it until after sending the
  response in order to deal with the self-imposed message
  mis-order. Asterisk previously dealt with this by pushing
  the NOTIFY in on_rx_refresh(), but pjsip now forces us
  to use it's method.</p>
<p>Changes were required to configure in order to detect
  which way pjsip handles this as the two are not
  compatible for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>A corresponding change in testsuite is required in order
  to deal with the small interal timing changes caused by
  moving the NOTIFY send.</p>

<h4>loader: Allow declined modules to be unloaded.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-12-08</p>
<p>Currently, if a module declines to load, dlopen is called
  to register the module but dlclose never gets called.
  Furthermore, loader.c currently doesn't allow dlclose
  to ever get called on the module, since it declined to
  load and the unload function bails early in this case.</p>
<p>This can be problematic if a module is updated, since the
  new module cannot be loaded into memory since we haven't
  closed all references to it. To fix this, we now allow
  modules to be unloaded, even if they never "loaded" in
  Asterisk itself, so that dlclose is called and the module
  can be properly cleaned up, allowing the updated module
  to be loaded from scratch next time.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_transport_websocket: Add remote port to transport</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2022-12-23</p>
<p>When Asterisk receives a new websocket conenction, it creates a new
  pjsip transport for it and copies connection data into it.  The
  transport manager then uses the remote IP address and port on the
  transport to create a monitor for each connection.  However, the
  remote port wasn't being copied, only the IP address which meant
  that the transport manager was creating only 1 monitoring entry for
  all websocket connections from the same IP address. Therefore, if
  one of those connections failed, it deleted the transport taking
  all the the connections from that same IP address with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>We now copy the remote port into the created transport and the

<h4>pbx_app: Update outdated pbx_exec channel snapshots.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-12-21</p>
<p>pbx_exec makes a channel snapshot before executing applications.
  This doesn't cause an issue during normal dialplan execution
  where pbx_exec is called over and over again in succession.
  However, if pbx_exec is called "one off", e.g. using
  ast_pbx_exec_application, then a channel snapshot never ends
  up getting made after the executed application returns, and
  inaccurate snapshot information will linger for a while, causing
  "core show channels", etc. to show erroneous info.</p>
<p>This is fixed by manually making a channel snapshot at the end
  of ast_pbx_exec_application, since we anticipate that pbx_exec
  might not get called again immediately.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_session: Use Caller ID for extension matching.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-11-26</p>
<p>Currently, there is no Caller ID available to us when
  checking for an extension match when handling INVITEs.
  As a result, extension patterns that depend on the Caller ID
  are not matched and calls may be incorrectly rejected.</p>
<p>The Caller ID is not available because the supplement that
  adds Caller ID to the session does not execute until after
  this check. Supplement callbacks cannot yet be executed
  at this point since the session is not yet in the appropriate
  state.</p>
<p>To fix this without impacting existing behavior, the Caller ID
  number is now retrieved before attempting to pattern match.
  This ensures pattern matching works correctly and there is
  no behavior change to the way supplements are called.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip_aoc: New module for sending advice-of-charge with chan_pjsip</h4>
<p>Author: Michael Kuron
  Date:   2022-10-23</p>
<p>chan_sip supported sending AOC-D and AOC-E information in SIP INFO
  messages in an "AOC" header in a format that was originally defined by
  Snom. In the meantime, ETSI TS 124 647 introduced an XML-based AOC
  format that is supported by devices from multiple vendors, including
  Snom phones with firmware &gt;= 8.4.2 (released in 2010).</p>
<p>This commit adds a new res_pjsip_aoc module that inserts AOC information
  into outgoing messages or sends SIP INFO messages as described below.
  It also fixes a small issue in res_pjsip_session which didn't always
  call session supplements on outgoing_response.</p>
<ul>
<li>AOC-S in the 180/183/200 responses to an INVITE request</li>
<li>AOC-S in SIP INFO (if a 200 response has already been sent or if the
    INVITE was sent by Asterisk)</li>
<li>AOC-D in SIP INFO</li>
<li>AOC-D in the 200 response to a BYE request (if the client hangs up)</li>
<li>AOC-D in a BYE request (if Asterisk hangs up)</li>
<li>AOC-E in the 200 response to a BYE request (if the client hangs up)</li>
<li>AOC-E in a BYE request (if Asterisk hangs up)</li>
</ul>
<p>The specification defines one more, AOC-S in an INVITE request, which
  is not implemented here because it is not currently possible in
  Asterisk to have AOC data ready at this point in call setup. Once
  specifying AOC-S via the dialplan or passing it through from another
  SIP channel's INVITE is possible, that might be added.</p>

<h4>res_adsi: Fix major regression caused by media format rearchitecture.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert

<p>The commit that rearchitected media formats,
  a2c912e9972c91973ea66902d217746133f96026 (ASTERISK_23114)
  introduced a regression by improperly translating code in res_adsi.c.
  In particular, the pointer to the frame buffer was initialized
  at the top of adsi_careful_send, rather than dynamically updating it
  for each frame, as is required.</p>
<p>This resulted in the first frame being repeatedly sent,
  rather than advancing through the frames.
  This corrupted the transmission of the CAS to the CPE,
  which meant that CPE would never respond with the DTMF acknowledgment,
  effectively completely breaking ADSI functionality.</p>
<p>This issue is now fixed, and ADSI now works properly again.</p>

<h4>pjsip_transport_events: Fix possible use after free on transport</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2022-10-10</p>
<p>It was possible for a module that registered for transport monitor
  events to pass in a pjsip_transport that had already been freed.
  This caused pjsip_transport_events to crash when looking up the
  monitor for the transport.  The fix is a two pronged approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We now increment the reference count on pjsip_transports when we
  create monitors for them, then decrement the count when the
  transport is going to be destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are now APIs to register and unregister monitor callbacks
  by "transport key" which is a string concatenation of the remote ip
  address and port.  This way the module needing to monitor the
  transport doesn't have to hold on to the transport object itself to
  unregister.  It just has to save the transport_key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the pjsip_transport reference increment and decrement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the internal transport monitor container key from the
    transport-&gt;obj_name (which may not be unique anyway) to the
    transport_key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a helper macro AST_SIP_MAKE_REMOTE_IPADDR_PORT_STR() that
    fills a buffer with the transport_key using a passed-in
    pjsip_transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the following functions:
    ast_sip_transport_monitor_register_key
    ast_sip_transport_monitor_register_replace_key
    ast_sip_transport_monitor_unregister_key
    and marked their non-key counterparts as deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated res_pjsip_pubsub and res_pjsip_outbound_register to use
    the new "key" monitor functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: res_pjsip_registrar also uses the transport monitor
  functionality but doesn't have a persistent object other than
  contact to store a transport key.  At this time, it continues to
  use the non-key monitor functions.</p>

  This is generally necessary in order to receive

  is nothing gained by waiting for one ring and this
  unnecessarily delays call setup. Users can now
  use immediate=yes to make FXO channels (FXS signaled)
  begin processing dialplan as soon as Asterisk receives
  the call.</p>

<h4>sla: Prevent deadlock and crash due to autoservicing.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-09-24</p>
<p>SLAStation currently autoservices the station channel before
  creating a thread to actually dial the trunk. This leads
  to duplicate servicing of the channel which causes assertions,
  deadlocks, crashes, and moreover not the correct behavior.</p>
<p>Removing the autoservice prevents the crash, but if the station
  hangs up before the trunk answers, the call hangs since the hangup
  was never serviced on the channel.</p>
<p>This is fixed by not autoservicing the channel, but instead
  servicing it in the thread dialing the trunk, since it is doing
  so synchronously to begin with. Instead of sleeping for 100ms
  in a loop, we simply use the channel for timing, and abort
  if it disappears.</p>
<p>The same issue also occurs with SLATrunk when a call is answered,
  because ast_answer invokes ast_waitfor_nandfds. Thus, we use
  ast_raw_answer instead which does not cause any conflict and allows
  the call to be answered normally without thread blocking issues.</p>

<h4>res_pjsip: prevent crash on websocket disconnect</h4>
<p>Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2022-10-13</p>
<p>When a websocket (or potentially any stateful connection) is quickly

<p>Depending on the timing, this can cause an assertion within pjsip.</p>
<p>To prevent this, ast_send_stateful_response will now create the group

  an entire channel and bridging and dial updates in the
  dialplan should not result in multiple CDR records being
  created for the call. With the ignore bridging option,
  bridging changes have no impact on the channel's CDRs.
  With the ignore dial state option, multiple Dials and their
  outcomes have no impact on the channel's CDRs. The
  last disposition on the channel is preserved in the CDR,
  so the actual disposition of the call remains available.</p>
<p>These two options can reduce the amount of "CDR hacks" that
  have hitherto been necessary to ensure that CDR was not
  "spoiled" by these messages if that was undesired, such as
  putting a dummy optimization-disabled local channel between
  the caller and the actual call and putting the CDR on the channel
  in the middle to ensure that CDR would persist for the entire
  call and properly record start, answer, and end times.
  Enabling these options is desirable when calls correspond
  to the entire lifetime of channels and the CDR should
  reflect that.</p>
<p>Current default behavior remains unchanged.</p>

<h4>res_geolocation:  Add built-in profiles</h4>
<p>Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2022-08-16</p>
<p>The trigger to perform outgoing geolocation processing is the
  presence of a geoloc_outgoing_call_profile on an endpoint. This
  is intentional so as to not leak location information to
  destinations that shouldn't receive it.   In a totally dynamic
  configuration scenario however, there may not be any profiles
  defined in geolocation.conf.  This makes it impossible to do
  outgoing processing without defining a "dummy" profile in the
  config file.</p>
<p>This commit adds 4 built-in profiles:
    "<prefer_config>"
    "<discard_config>"
    "<prefer_incoming>"
    "<discard_incoming>"
  The profiles are empty except for having their precedence
  set and can be set on an endpoint to allow processing without
  entries in geolocation.conf.  "<discard_config>" is actually the
  best one to use in this situation.</p>

  This adds documentation for these responses.</p>

<h4>pbx_functions.c: Manually update ast_str strlen.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-07-23</p>
<p>When ast_func_read2 is used to read a function using
  its read function (as opposed to a native ast_str read2
  function), the result is copied directly by the function
  into the ast_str buffer. As a result, the ast_str length
  remains initialized to 0, which is a bug because this is
  not the real string length.</p>
<p>This can cascade and have issues elsewhere, such as when
  reading substrings of functions that only register read
  as opposed to read2 callbacks. In this case, since reading
  ast_str_strlen returns 0, the returned substring is empty
  as opposed to the actual substring. This has caused
  the ast_str family of functions to behave inconsistently
  and erroneously, in contrast to the pbx_variables substitution
  functions which work correctly.</p>
<p>This fixes this issue by manually updating the ast_str length
  when the result is copied directly into the ast_str buffer.</p>
<p>Additionally, an assertion and a unit test that previously
  exposed these issues are added, now that the issue is fixed.</p>

<h4>build: fix bininstall launchd issue on cross-platform build</h4>
<p>Author: Sergey V. Lobanov
  Date:   2022-02-19</p>
<p>configure script detects /sbin/launchd, but the result of this
  check is not used in Makefile (bininstall). Makefile also detects
  /sbin/launchd file to decide if it is required to install
  safe_asterisk.</p>
<p>configure script correctly detects cross compile build and sets
  PBX_LAUNCHD=0</p>
<p>In case of building asterisk on MacOS host for Linux target using
  external toolchain (e.g. OpenWrt toolchain), bininstall does not
  install safe_asterisk (due to /sbin/launchd detection in Makefile),
  but it is required on target (Linux).</p>
<p>This patch adds HAVE_SBIN_LAUNCHD=@PBX_LAUNCHD@ to makeopts.in to
  use the result of /sbin/launchd detection from configure script in
  Makefile.
  Also this patch uses HAVE_SBIN_LAUNCHD in Makefile (bininstall) to
  decide if it is required to install safe_asterisk.</p>

<h4>manager: Fix incomplete filtering of AMI events.</h4>
<p>Author: Naveen Albert
  Date:   2022-07-12</p>
<p>The global event filtering code was only in one
  possible execution path, so not all events were
  being properly filtered out if requested. This moves
  that into the universal AMI handling code so all
  events are properly handled.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CLI listing of disabled events can
  also get truncated, so we now print out everything.</p>

<p>Adds the DBGetTree action, which can be used to
  retrieve all of the DB keys beginning with a
  particular prefix, similar to the capability
  provided by the database show CLI command.</p>
